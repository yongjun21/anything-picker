Ichiban Montessori aims to provide a dynamic, independent learning environment that is hands-on and student-driven for children ages 2 to 6 years old. Children develop inner-discipline, a love of learning, and learn at their own pace guided by the Montessori technique, which promotes individual initiative and creativity. We want our students to experience such a positive impact on their learning that our parents would never consider having them attend pre-school anywhere else!","scheme_type":"Partner Operator Scheme","weekday_full_day":"07:00-19:00","centre_contact_no":"63143298","k1_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years","_id":213,"food_offered":"No Pork No Lard with No Beef(without Certification from MUIS but from Halal Sources)","pg_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years","n2_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years","gst_regisration":"Yes","centre_name":"ICHIBAN MONTESSORI CHILD CARE CENTRE PTE LTD","organisation_description":"PRIVATE","k2_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years"},{"provision_of_transport":"No","last_updated":"2017-10-24","spark_certified":"No","extended_operating_hours":"Yes","second_languages_offered":"Chinese","postal_code":"730369","centre_website":"www.facebook.com/bumblebeeccc","saturday":"07:00-14:00","centre_address":"Blk 369, WOODLANDS AVENUE 1, #01 - 853, SINGAPORE 730369","n1_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years","infant_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years","government_subsidy":"Yes","organisation_code":"PT","iccp":"No","centre_email_address":"support@bumbleb3.com","centre_code":"PT3150","weekday_halfday_am":"na","weekday_halfday_pm":"na","remarks":"na","scheme_type":"na","weekday_full_day":"07:00-19:30","centre_contact_no":"63630234","k1_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years","_id":214,"food_offered":"No Pork No Lard with No Beef(without Certification from MUIS but from Halal Sources)","pg_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years","n2_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years","gst_regisration":"No","centre_name":"BUMBLE BEE CHILD CARE CENTRE","organisation_description":"PRIVATE","k2_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years"},{"provision_of_transport":"Yes","last_updated":"2017-11-15","spark_certified":"No","extended_operating_hours":"No","second_languages_offered":"Chinese","postal_code":"536668","centre_website":"www.blossomedugroup.com.sg","saturday":"07:00-14:00","centre_address":"7, LORONG BATAWI, SINGAPORE 536668","n1_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","infant_vacancy":"No vacancies for the next 1-2 years","government_subsidy":"Yes","organisation_code":"PT","iccp":"No","centre_email_address":"bec@blossomedugroup.com.sg","centre_code":"PT3190","weekday_halfday_am":"07:00-13:00","weekday_halfday_pm":"13:00-19:00","remarks":"Blossom Edugroup is a consortium of educational institutions that prides ourselves as providers of quality child care and pre-school education in Singapore since 2002.

Our highly effective Montessori Phonics Programme enables our children to read and spell words confidently by end of K1.  All our teachers are qualified and trained. To ensure quality care and consistent teaching, we don?t outsource our enrichment programme to external vendors. All our enrichment programmes except table tennis are our in-house full time teachers. We have a full time certified Gymnastic and trampoline trainer and a full time Art teacher who are also trained in early childhood. Your child's beautiful day begins with us. We strongly believe in providing our children a non-stressful, happy and enjoyable early childhood. All enquiries are welcome. Prior appointment needed if you wish to visit our centre. Please contact us for appointment for a tour of our centre. You are strongly encouraged to bring your child along for the viewing as we respect children's choice of school. We strive to keep school fees affordable by not increasing the fees payable of our existing children as long as we can cope with the rising cost of teachers' salary and the rental of premises.","scheme_type":"na","weekday_full_day":"07:00-19:00","centre_contact_no":"64551803","k1_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","_id":857,"food_offered":"No Pork No Lard with No Beef(without Certification from MUIS but from Halal Sources)","pg_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","n2_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","gst_regisration":"No","centre_name":"SUNNY BUNNY MONTESSORI PTE.
