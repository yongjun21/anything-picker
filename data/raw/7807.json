		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Our school's name, Spectra, represents the school's philosophy of recognising the spectrum of talents and strengths of our students. It signifies our belief that every child is different and unique. It is our goal to expand the potential of our students. We provide multiple platforms to help every student shine to the brightest. We envision a caring school culture that is affirmative and leverages the strengths of our students. There will be room for students to make mistakes, learn from them and grow, and to become special persons who make a difference to the lives of others. Our school motto, \"Together We Can\", exemplifies the \"kampung\" spirit of togetherness and collective effort. It signals our commitment to working with parents and partners to nurture and develop our students. Hence, we envision our school to be a close-knit community. We see ourselves becoming a self-sustaining and nurturing eco-system that brings out the best in those who work, study and play here.  At the end of Sec 4, our students will graduate with the GCE 'N' Level Certificate and the ITE Skills Subject Certificate (ISSC).",
