			"Westwood Primary was founded in 2013, premised on the core philosophy of Positive Education.  Our overarching goal is for our staff and pupils to strive for both excellence and wellbeing, and for our school community to thrive and flourish.  Learning is delivered with positive engagement so as to invite every pupil on a journey of discovery and holistic development.  Discipline is promoted in a respectful way to engender self-reflection and growth.  By emphasising positive motivation and affirmative attitudes, we nurture an awareness of greatness and potential in each and every staff and pupil, as they set personalised goals and ultimately demonstrate creative expression, problem-solving, and meaningful achievement.  ",
			"In keeping with the philosophy of Positive Education, Westwood Primary's Staff Belief is that Every One is a Talented and Unique Individual with Potential for Success. Our Westwood School Culture is one of care, love and drive, and we aspire in going the extra mile in everything we do.  To enable all staff and pupils to believe that he or she can be an agent of change, with opportunities to use his or her talents and skills to benefit others, our positive school culture is grounded in our core values of A Heart of Gratitude, A Resilient Mindset, A Passion for Community and A Future-Ready Confidence.",
			"A THRIVE Framework for Positive Education has been developed to ensure that school policies, practices and programmes are aligned to the six key domains of positive accomplishment (Thinking mindfully); positive health (Healthy coping); positive relationship (Relating well); positive engagement (In the moment); positive meaning (Values-driven actions); and positive emotions (Emotions of positivity).  To this end, we actively partner parents and the wider community, seeking opportunities to contribute to community life, while living out the message of positivity, hope and well-being."
