		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our teaching and learning programme caters to the diverse talents and abilities of students to support and stretch their learning such as the Achievers and Scholars programmes. With the use of 1-to-1 Personal Learning Device, students are engaged in self-directed and collaborative learning anywhere and anytime. Our Growing Leaders programme in the area of student leadership is our Learning for Life Programme (LLP). We believe that every student has the potential to become a confident leader of sound character through structured, differentiated, and meaningful experiences provided in the student leadership programme. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Visual Communication offers a spread of enriched Arts-related programmes that equip students with the skills and knowledge of how visual images, texts and contexts can be used creatively to communicate powerful messages to their intended audience through programmes such as photo-journalism and video-making. The Enhanced Art Programme, a special Art curriculum for selected students who demonstrate a high level of interest in visual art, provides them with opportunities to learn a wide variety of art-making techniques from master artists and overseas immersion programmes. Developing Innovative Learners through Design Thinking (DT) is another signature programme where students actively seek to understand problems faced by users and develop innovative solutions using the DT approach. The Values In Action programme for Sec 3 students allows them to initiate, lead and work in groups to carry out a year-long service learning project to serve the community. The Co-curricular Activities programme nurtures talents and shapes character by providing opportunities for students to hone their leadership skills, build team and school spirit, and cultivate an appreciation for the outdoors and the aesthetics. At Sec 3, every student can participate in an overseas learning trip to develop a global outlook and be culturally savvy."
