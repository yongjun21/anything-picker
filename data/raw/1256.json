		"School Mission": "To nurture and empower our students to realise their potential and aspirations so as to have a positive and significant impact in the school and community",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"Cantonment Primary School believes that a student's holistic growth begins from a caring and collaborative school culture and tone. Cultivating this culture and tone is each staff member's responsibility and is demonstrated in the different facets of the school's curriculum deliveries; in how lessons are planned, how learning is shared, how safety is managed, how discipline is enforced and how relationships and partnerships are built. We also believe that a caring and collaborative culture does not compromise on the high academic standards and rigor expected. On the contrary; because a caring culture is about accountability for the students' academic performance, accountability to address the varied student needs, and accountability for the quality of programs offered, and because a collaborative culture is about progressing sharper learning with the help of others and vice versa.",
			"A caring culture is the base from which we develop students who are \"Concerned Citizens, Innovative Thinkers, Passionate Learners\" as articulated in our school vision. In the course of their six-year journey, we hope that our students strengthen the caring culture in how they conduct themselves as a member of the school and community and in what they accomplish for self and for school.",
			"We believe that every child has the propensity to be persons of good character. We believe that every child should be given the opportunity to serve and lead others. We believe that the home, school and community play equally important roles in shaping the child. This last belief is the critical collaboration that we work towards in our mission goals."
