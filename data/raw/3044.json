		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "To deliver the school mission, we adopted Arthur L. Costa's Habits of Mind (HOM) since 2003 to inculcate in BBSSians thinking dispositions. These dispositions are taught explicitly via activity-based lessons and every student would habitually practise HOM daily so as to prepare them for future challenges as self-directed learners. Our students possess the strength of character to do well academically and in their CCAs, thus actualising our school vision of providing quality holistic education. This is delivered through our LLP, Community Youth Leadership Programme, which aims to nurture RESPECTful Leaders who are self-directed in serving the community with abundance mentality. It integrates the twin pillars of Leadership Development and Values In Action (VIA) to provide BBSSians with leadership training experiences and opportunities to organise community-wide events like Blood Donation Drive, and overseas service learning expeditions as part of our Internationalisation Programme. Such projects aim to develop dispositions like \"Listening with Understanding and Empathy\" and \"Questioning and Problem Posing\". Our ALP is in the area of embedded electronics which builds upon our strength in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to develop BBSSians as proactive problem-solvers by focusing on the application of sensor technologies, coding and mBOT robots to simple real-life scenarios. Our students' innate abilities are cultivated through our Talent Development Programme where we facilitate many student-initiated interest groups like aesthetic performances by dance groups and singers, mind games get-together with Scrabble and Rubik's Cube, technology-driven enthusiasts through drones and robotics, and communication via radio DJ shows and history. All these holistic experiences cultivate students' joy of learning thus developing their disposition of \"Remaining open to Continuous Learning\" which will prepare the students well for the future."
