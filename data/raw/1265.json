			"West Spring Primary was established in 2014. We are guided by our philosophy that a positive learning environment that provides opportunities for students to experience big and small successes can be attained through meaningful learning and character development opportunities. This belief is captured through the school song that encourages students to be \"thankful for this day [where they] will have joy in [their] hearts and love in [their] souls as [they] work towards [their] goals\". We believe students enjoy coming to school when they are able to experience small and big successes. ",
			"Through this belief, the school's approach to teaching and learning includes taking a refreshing approach to make learning a joy, engaging and effective in mastering the skills and developing the disposition and attitude that will keep them open to lifelong learning.  ",
			"The students' joy in coming to school is due to the hard work of the school community of committed teachers, staff and very supportive parents and partners who believe in the school's vision. The school community aspires for excellence in our pursuits. "
