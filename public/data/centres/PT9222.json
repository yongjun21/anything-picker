  "remarks": "This centre was set up as our centre at Sin Ming Avenue ran out of places. We run authentic Montessori Programme inclusive of phonics and Chinese Language lessons. Our fee is inclusive of Table-Tennis, Speech and Drama, Dance, Scientific Investigation, Music and Movement, Chinese Words Recognition which aims at getting children to recognise 1500 words by the end of K2, Art and Craft and Puppetry Literacy. All enrichment programmes  are conducted in both English and Chinese. There are no other hidden costs. Moral Education is incorporated seamlessly into our daily circle time. Our highly effective Montessori Phonics Programme enables our children to read and spell words confidently by end of K1.  All our teachers are qualified and trained. To ensure quality care and consistent teaching, we don?t outsource our enrichment programme to external vendors. All our enrichment programmes except table tennis are our in-house full time teachers. We have a full time certified Gymnastic and trampoline trainer and a full time Art teacher who are also trained in early childhood. Your child's beautiful day begins with us. We strongly believe in providing our children a non-stressful, happy and enjoyable early childhood. All enquiries are welcome. Prior appointment needed if you wish to visit our centre. Please contact us for appointment for a tour of our centre. You are strongly encouraged to bring your child along for the viewing as we respect children's choice of school. We strive to keep school fees affordable by not increasing the fees payable of our existing children as long as we can cope with the rising cost of teachers' salary and the rental of premises.",
