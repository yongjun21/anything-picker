Carpe Diem @ Hilltop is sited atop an elevated plane, which is both exclusive and accessible, and thus affords it the vast open field, fresh air and generous outdoor space that are highly conducive for a rich education.  Thanks to its expansive space and greenery, Carpe Diem @ Hilltop is able to incorporate a host of outdoor amenities that promotes explorative and experiential learning, such as: a children's playground; a pet house; areas for outdoor cycling, art and craft activities, sand play and water play; a vegetable and fruit garden; and alfresco dining. We are also exploring the feasibility to build a tree- house to double up as an outdoor classroom.   Coupled with the integrated Multiple Intelligences (MI) curriculum developed by renowned educational psychologist, Dr Howard Gardner (Harvard University), Carpe Diem @ Hilltop is set to be the best start to your child's lifelong learning journey.  With a reliable reputation that has earned us the Superbrands award for three consecutive years (2004, 2005 and 2006), Singapore Prestige Brand Award in 2009, rest assured that Carpe Diem is Your Partner in Your Child's Development. So, 'Carpe Diem*!'",
