			"At Elias Park, we believe that education must develop the whole child - the Scholar, Sportsman, Artist, Leader and Citizen in every individual student and his values system. That is why our key focus is on the holistic development of students and providing the platform and opportunities for them to realize their potential in the cognitive, physical, aesthetics, leadership, social and emotional domains. We pride ourselves in giving our students an authentic and experiential learning environment, extending the classroom to beyond 'bricks and mortar' - this is what we call the 'Elias Experience'. Our approach has produced confident and well-rounded individuals who can excel in both academic and non-academic domains. ",
			"Our school culture is based on the principles of autonomy, learning and care with a strong focus on professional development of our staff so that they are better equipped to deliver the Elias Experience to our students. We believe that every individual who joins the school wants to do his best, is worthy of respect and deserves to be heard. We aim to build a robust and trusting relationship with our students, staff and other stakeholders, including parents who are important partners in our educational journey with their children."
