		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "1. Character Development through Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE): Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is a broad-based developmental programme that spans from Sec 1 to 3, with extended opportunities for students with special interest in outdoor activities to be trained as outdoor leaders.  It provides students with authentic, real-world experiences to learn teamwork, build mental and emotional strength, develop self and collective leadership through taking on physical challenges. 2. Critical Social Inquiry (CSI) and Media Literacy: Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) extends students' learning from subjects such as Languages, Humanities and CCE. Students collaborate, search, organise and evaluate rich resources such as written texts, short films and forum theatre to deepen their understanding of social issues. There are opportunities to participate in interest-based modules, such as broadcasting and journalism workshops as well as film and media appreciation.  3. Enhanced Music Programme (EMP): Our comprehensive music programme offers students opportunities to learn, create, and perform music through various platforms. The two-year Music Preparatory Course (MPC) for lower secondary, with EMP in upper secondary, culminates in the O-Level Music or Higher Music examinations. Students gain strong music fundamentals and enjoy a vibrant enrichment programme that includes concerts, masterclasses, arts internships, collaborations, and external mentorship programmes. 4. Student-initiated Service Learning Programme: To inspire courage to lead and serve, every class takes part in a structured 8-week programme to identify the need of a community to plan and implement a service learning project. 5. With the school's firm belief in academic resilience and stretching student potential, outstanding students are nominated for programmes such as journalism training, creative writing camp and science innovation project."
