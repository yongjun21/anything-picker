		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "In line with the school's vision, 'Enterprising Learners for Excellence', the school develops key programmes that cater to the diverse profile of students. Student leadership development in Yuying provides all students with opportunities to take on leadership roles and receive tiered leadership training anchored on 21st century competencies. Grounded in leadership principles, the Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) seeks to nurture students to become community youth leaders. Through Values-in-Action activities in the LLP, students are given opportunities to be environmental advocates and social changemakers. To foster inventive and critical thinking for enterprising learners, the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) trains students in the Design Thinking protocol to solve real-life problems. Through ALP, students develop both cognitive and affective empathy in the process of ideating and creating solutions for a better future for the community. The school also taps on its Vertical Farming resource to design authentic and experiential learning experiences for students when teaching subject-specific concepts. This makes learning meaningful for students. Industry partnerships and attachment opportunities provide our students the insights to the skills and competencies necessary for them to be future-ready. In addition, students are able to identify their areas of strengths and interests beyond the context of a classroom. With heightened self-awareness, many are able to pursue their passion and engage in purposeful learning."
