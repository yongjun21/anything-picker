			"The heart of learning in Northland Primary School NPS) is encapsulated in our vision:Firm Foundations, Future Learnings. The vision takes reference from MOE's direction to better prepare our students for the 21st century world.",
			"Building a Firm Foundation in Every Child",
			"At NPS, we seek to provide our students with a strong academic foundation that is rooted in deep understanding. It is based on our core beliefs that learning for understanding makes learning more meaningful and academic learning must extend beyond examination results and the knowledge of just facts and skills.",
			"Besides nurturing our students to strive for their personal best, we believe that a holistic education will serve the needs of our students in the future. We actively seek to mould our students to become critical thinkers and lifelong learners so that they can appreciate the present and thrive in any endeavour in the future.",
			"Enabling Every Child to Grow, Serve and Excel",
			"NPS places a strong emphasis in inculcating sound moral and social values in our students. Our five core values of Compassion, Lifelong Learning, Integrity, Teamwork and Excellence serve as a compass to guide all Northlanders in their thoughts and actions. Students are taught to demonstrate their love and concern for others and their environment through numerous platforms set up for them, like the Values-In-Action and Student-Initiated projects. One example is the completion of Acts of Kindness cards by students to remind themselves to make a conscious effort to show kindness to others.",
			"Here in NPS, on top of the progressive and differentiated student-centric curriculum, we offer an array of structured enrichment programmes from co-curricular programmes like International Chess Club to fun-filled activities during recess (like Art & Craft; Information Communication Technology infused Games; storytelling sessions), as well as daily pre-assembly talks and learning journeys that expose students to learning beyond the classrooms."
