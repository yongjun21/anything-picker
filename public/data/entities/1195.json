			"The Rulang family is bonded by the culture of excellence, collegiality and teamwork. This culture and working ethics are based on the acronyms TRUE HEARTs where every staff is valued and every effort recognized and celebrated. The TRUE HEART culture spurs the staff towards quality staff work and school pride. ",
			"The TRUE HEARTs philosophy has also been cascaded to all Rulangnites. A Rulangnite is taught to never stop questioning, encouraged to blaze his own trail instead of accepting barriers, and to infuse the TRUE HEARTs culture and spirit into his everyday life. This will instill in Rulangnites the core leadership values of having integrity, being morally upright, and being a risk taker. ",
			"We believe that Rulangnites can achieve peaks of excellence by being the best that they can be in their chosen fields.  Upon completion of their primary education, they will each graduate as an accomplished learner, a loyal citizen, an effective leader and a cosmopolitan."
