			"Our philosophy: We believe that all children can learn and achieve when they are given the right environment and support",

			"E: Empathy (Think, feel, do good for others)",
			"We want to build a culture of PRIDE among our pupils in line with the 21st CC skills as well as our vision and mission statement. We want our pupils to develop Passion - a strong love for people around them and to also feel that sense of love and rootedness to Singapore. In addition, that love should also be extended to learning. We want pupils to have a desire to continually seek out knowledge and use that knowledge to benefit others and society. We also want to develop in our pupils the values of Resilience to face challenges and be adaptable to the changing world around them, always putting in their best effort and seeking solutions to various obstacles and problems they may encounter. We also hope to nurture upright and moral citizens of Singapore who will have integrity, being honest and truthful in all circumstances. Diligence is also key in helping our pupils achieve their goals and in so doing, they would appreciate that there is value in hard work. We also want to nurture the value of Empathy in our pupils - to help them consider the needs of the people around them, to open their eyes to the community in which they live in and to awaken in them a realisation that they can impact and make a difference in the lives of the people around them."
