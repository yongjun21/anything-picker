		"School Vision": "Rooted in Values; Ready for the Future; Gem of the Community",
		"School Mission": "To develop each student to be a life-long learner, a leader with character, a success in his own right so as to serve the community.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"The school believes that education for our young goes beyond just the years they are with us and that they should be equipped for a life beyond. As we forge ahead in future, we want to emphasise the development of school values and 21st century competencies so that our children will be able to navigate the uncertain, but exciting future. We embrace the following shared school values - An Inquiring, Imaginative Mind, Value Self and Others, Integrity and Doing Our Best - to foster a community of learners and responsible citizens. Our school motto \"Strive to Succeed\", underpins Pioneer's spirit of excellence.",
			"The school sets four strategic thrusts (STs) to realise the vision:",
			"ST 1: From Exam-Ready to Future-Ready. We provide a holistic and future-ready curriculum which leverages technology to develop 21st century competencies in students. There are opportunities for students to personalise learning, reflect on their work, think critically and engage frequently in deep understanding through Project Work.",
			"ST 2: From Desire to Discipline. We provide Mediated Learning Experience, and a spectrum of customised programmes to develop in our students the passion, the skills and the grit for learning. We build in students the discipline in thinking, in living and in action so as to bring about their joy in learning.",
			"ST 3: From Teaching to Transforming. Teacher is the key to the success of students. The school focuses on continuous learning of the staff in pedagogy, curriculum and assessment. Beyond teaching students to achieve good results, our teachers acquire the knowledge and skills to transform their students to live successful lives.",
			"ST 4: Synergistic Partnerships with Parents and the Community. A key factor of Pioneer's high quality of education is the partnership between the school, parents, partners and community. We set up our partnership framework to bring about authentic influence and opportunities to develop our students."
