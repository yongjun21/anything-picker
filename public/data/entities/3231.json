		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Design and Aeronautical Engineering @ Ping Yi (our Applied Learning Programme in the area of STEM) provides our students the opportunity to be trained extensively in the Design Protocol, a design process skillset that gives students a structured approach towards enhancing their critical thinking skills in design principles, and developing ideas and solutions. They learn the Art and Science of Flight: from Aerodynamics (the theory of flight), to Aeronautics (the movement of planes in the air) and Aircraft Design (flying with style). Design and aeronautical fundamentals have also been integrated into the Maths and Science curriculum to deepen student understanding. In partnership with Polytechnics and industry partners, and through our own series of authentic learning experiences and workshops, our students take up the challenges of design and production in a fun and dynamic way. Elements of entrepreneurship are introduced to allow students to conduct feasibility and scalability studies, and to communicate their proposals effectively. Our Leadership through Character and Citizenship Education (our Life-long Learning Programme in the area of Community and Youth Leadership) programme provides opportunities for students to develop desired character traits like resilience, tenacity, initiative, team spirit and an orientation towards excellence. Annual level camps, values-in-action activities, work attachment experiences, local and overseas service learning, the NYAA platform and leadership modules provide ample opportunities for students to develop their competencies and to serve the community."
