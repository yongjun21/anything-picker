			"Established in 1951, Haig Girls' School (HGS) is an all-girls' government primary school.  Our school has a heritage of excellent all-round education.  Nurturing character, leadership and creativity is the hallmark of an education at HGS that has endured over the decades. We believe in nurturing the whole child and preparing our pupils for life through a distinctive learning experience that is values-based, engaging, rigorous and innovative. ",
			"Our shared values are encapsulated in our I4Cs: Integrity, Commitment, Concern, Cooperation, and Creativity. Guided by our school motto 'Ars Potens Est' ('Knowledge is Power'), we strive to nurture every Haig girl to use her knowledge, skills and talents in service to the school, community and nation.   We believe that our pupils are never too young to make a difference and give them a voice through advocacy, service, creative expression and innovation.",
			"HGS is a second home to our pupils - a safe, nurturing environment for them to be themselves and to grow and learn. We believe in the uniqueness and worth of every child - each child is different, special and talented in her own way and we seek to bring out the best in her. We love, value and accept each child for who she is regardless of her results or achievements, but we hold her to high expectations. In HGS, we would like each child to take responsibility for her learning and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn, grow and excel. We believe in a growth mindset -- with effort, perseverance and resilience, every child can think, learn, achieve and excel."
