			"Qifa Primary School, previously known as Khee Fatt Study Institution  was set up in 1906 by the Char Yong (Dabu) Association.  The school commemorated its 30th anniversary as a government school in 2015, and 110 years as a Hakka school started by the Char Yong (Dabu) Association in 2016. As a government school, Qifa continues to enjoy a good and unique relationship with its founding organisation. ",
			"Qifa is a choice school in the Clementi/West Coast neighbourhood, with the school conducting balloting in the P1 Registration Exercise since 2010.  Over the years, the school has garnered many accolades, and it is recognised by its stakeholders for its rigorous academic programmes, stellar Aesthetics and Co-curricular outcomes as well as a range of non-academic programmes that cater to the all-round development of its pupils.  These achievements are made possible by a team of dedicated and forward-looking staff together with the support of parents, ex-students and the School Advisory Committee.",
			"Through delivering a quality, holistic and value-added education that recognises and develops pupils of diverse abilities and talents, the school seeks to realise its vision to be \"an achieving school with a caring environment\"."
