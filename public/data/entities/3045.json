This student-centric approach in educating our students can also be seen in our curriculum. It is designed and implemented by our caring and professional team of teachers who embrace the core belief of 'leave no child behind'. The curriculum is crafted with the learners in mind and seeks to deepen our students' understanding of the various disciplines, making learning engaging and meaningful for them. Working closely with supportive parents and alumni, as well as the community and other partners in education, there is a strong community of support in YTSS to create a nurturing environment and provide the best learning experience for all YTzens. The school motto, 'We will Excel' is the guiding beacon for all YTzens and it permeates the school culture. The various awards and accolades the school is accorded and has achieved are testimonies of our steadfast commitment to excellence.",
