We adopt a three-pronged approach by engaging the 'Head', 'Heart' and 'Hands' to develop our students' cognitive abilities through Design Thinking. We also cultivate their character by inculcating the values of altruism, and build skills by equipping them with the 21st Century Competencies. To facilitate our students' development, we also leverage customised learning spaces such as Maker-Space to develop them as designers and creators of new knowledge and skills."
