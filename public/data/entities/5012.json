			"Core Belief: Loving Each Child as our Own",
			"Established as part of the St. Gabriel's School in 1953, the school follows the footsteps of our founder, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, whose belief was to 'Love each child as a son of God'. Staff strives to love each child as our own. ",
			"Educational Philosophy : Keeping the Flame Alive, The Gift is Theirs, Giving Pupils a Voice, The Community Connect",
			"We are committed to truly educating the students by nurturing in them, the 'flame of inquiry' so that they will be prepared for a life of learning. A suite of effective academic programmes cater to the different learning needs, styles and interests of our pupils - the Inquiry Week, the Louis Marie de Montfort (LMM) class for the academically gifted, and bridging programmes for those who need the support. We believe that every child is 'gifted' and inspire them to discover their potential. A stable of co-curricular activities that is varied and interesting provides an exciting and immersive school experience for students. Each child is given a 'voice' so that they may learn to have a heart for others, through service to God and the nation. We provide opportunities for students to live out the school virtues of Self-discipline, Generosity, Perseverance, Sincerity, Loyalty, Orderliness, Respect and Diligence through opportunities to 'connect with the community'.",
			"Motto : 'Labor Omnia Vincit' (Labour conquers all) ",
			"The motto personifies the importance of giving one's best in all endeavours. It is our hope that each student will approach learning with passion and perseverance; that he will form lasting friendships and thus understand the meaning of loyalty, sincerity and fellowship; that he will become socially responsible citizens who would learn from the youngest age how to give of themselves for the greater good; that he will laugh and play and enjoy being a boy. Above all, he must always be mindful of God's grace and presence."
