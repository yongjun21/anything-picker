Our teachers care deeply and will give their utmost support and guidance to their students. Our school is a safe and nurturing home - grounded in positive discipline, care and concern that values every individual. Riding on the legacy of resilience, resourcefulness and responsibility by our pioneers, the school spirit inspires all to live these virtues and to build a strong school identity and affiliation.
