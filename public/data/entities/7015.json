		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "In St Andrew's Secondary, we develop Saints to be Servant Leaders, equipped with 21st Century competencies including critical thinking and grounded with WISE and TRUE values. Saints undertake a variety of Values-in-action projects to serve the community, both local and overseas. The school offers customized programmes and pedagogical approaches catering to students' varied interests and strengths, to help them develop strength of character, a strong learning disposition and 21 CC skills and competencies. At the Lower Secondary level our Applied Learning programme on Engineering Design equips Saints with problem solving skills using Critical Thinking and the Design Thinking framework. Saints get to identify themselves as engineers and are inspired to creatively design solutions to authentic issues. In key programmes like the Young Scientist programme and the Oral History project, Saints learn and apply problem solving skills in real world contexts. At Upper Secondary level, Saints embark on project-based learning via the Elective subjects they pursue. This encourages discovery, exploratory learning and problem solving so that they can make sense of their world and better prepare for work. Our distinctive Rugby for Life programme leverages on the school's long-standing tradition in this rugged and disciplined sport."
