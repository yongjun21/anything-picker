Some of these Apps have been featured in the iTunes store. Our robust Character and Citizenship Education Programme provides every student with leadership opportunities. The school offers its Global Education Programme with the desire to allow every Dunmanite to have an overseas experience to develop global awareness and rootedness to Singapore.  Our vibrant Values-in-Action programme enables students to serve the community and society at large. The school is one of the five pilot schools selected by MOE to implement a total curriculum that infuses the teaching of 21st century competencies. The Dunman All-Round Excellence (DARE) Framework undergirds our focus on holistic education to nurture ethical change-makers.
