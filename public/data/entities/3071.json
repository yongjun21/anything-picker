Approaches like Assessment for Learning, Inquiry-Based Learning and Story-telling allow students a stronger grasp of subjects like English Language, Humanities, and the Arts. Experiential Learning opportunities provided in collaboration with the polytechnics which offer Advanced Elective Modules complement learning in the Sciences.  The school also offers Exercise and Sports Science as a GCE O-Level Subject for students keen on pursuing their studies in sports science. Through its Affective Programmes such as the Leadership Programme, the NV Goes Global Programme and Character Education Programmes, students are offered a broad range of experiences both within and beyond our shores. The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Investigative Science in Health and Sports, develops students' interest in learning through investigative science and forensics. The Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Nurturing Creative Problem Solving through Arts and Design, aims to develop active citizens who are able to empathise with, and respond creatively to the needs of the community. Students gain authentic learning experiences through Vista Week which provides them with a week of culture, adventure and reflection. Enrichment programmes are carried out on Terrific Thursdays and Fabulous Fridays during which Vistarians leave the comfort of their classrooms for learning experiences that are catered to their varied talents and interests."
