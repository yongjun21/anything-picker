		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "To develop 21 CC competencies in our GESPians and prepare them for life-long learning, the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) places emphasis on the acquisition of values and life skills focusing on music and the performing arts. The LLP provides students with different intensity of learning engagement according to their levels. In the cognitive domain, varied learning activities are planned, ranging from the Math Olympiad and Code for Fun for the high progress learners to motivational programmes and additional support in-and after-school for low progress learners. In PAL, P1 and P2 students are exposed to various modules, such as  Visual Arts and Outdoor Education modules. They are designed to be experiential, enjoyable and encompass learning in a creative way; incorporating values and social and emotional learning. These PAL activities have also been scaled up to benefit the P3 and P4 students. Students with potential are identified and encouraged to join the related CCAs. Opportunities are also created to allow them to engage in informal/formal performances to build their confidence and showcase their talents.   "
