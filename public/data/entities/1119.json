		"Vice Principal (Admin)": "Miss Usha Rani Henry",
		"School Vision": "Guided by values, every Eunosian a happy learner, a confident communicator and a critical thinker",
		"School Mission": "Nurturing every child in a caring and vibrant environment to achieve his/her personal best and contribute actively to society",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"Every staff in Eunos Primary is committed to the school philosophy \"Every child can learn and achieve in a caring environment\". This commitment is evident in the tireless efforts to provide every student with opportunities to develop holistically. ",
			"In the cognitive domain, the school has developed in-house programmes to meet the differing needs of her students. Two examples are the HEALS programme (Helping and Enabling All Learners to Succeed) - a differentiated literacy curriculum to strengthen our students' literacy skills and the ICAN programme (Improve Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy) aimed at levelling up our students' confidence and proficiency in Mathematics. To help students develop to be Critical Thinkers, the school's Aesthetics department has adopted the use of Making Thinking Visible routines.",
			"In the aesthetics domain, the school prides itself on providing opportunities for our students to attend performing arts events such as watching the musical Les Miserables as well as putting up public performances. In 2016, the school's third public performance Euni-Voices received many accolades. ",
			"In the physical domain, the school has developed a Healthy Eating Project aimed at educating our students on how to make healthier food choices and prepare nutritious meals independently. Students are also exposed to a variety of sports programmes such as roller-blading and archery. To encourage an active lifestyle, the annual Eunos Olympiad provides the opportunity for staff, students and parents to bond while participating in sports and games.",
			"Believing in the importance of a close School-Home partnership for the benefit of our students, Supportive Parents in Community Engagement (SPICE @ Eunos) was set up in 2011. Through this strong partnership, our students are exposed to invaluable learning opportunities including short attachments to various companies and industries as part of education career guidance."
