We lead, care and inspire each other as colleagues. We seek to engage and collaborate with our partners for the benefit of our students. With these core beliefs, we care for every staff and student. We ensure that every lesson is a good lesson, and that every learning activity is purposeful. We encourage every staff and student to reflect and learn from every opportunity and from each other.

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Swiss Cottage delivers a Total Curriculum covering a comprehensive Student Development Programme, a rigorous Instructional Programme and two Distinctive Programmes: Swiss Thoughtful Leadership Programme (TLP) and Applied Sciences for Sustainable Development Programme. The TLP integrates Student Leadership, Values in-Action (VIA), and our school-based Glocal (global and local) Perspectives programmes. It provides our students with the knowledge, skills and values to explore and embark on possible VIA or social action projects. The Applied Sciences for Sustainable Development Programme aims to equip our students with specialised scientific skills and knowledge through the curriculum and authentic learning platforms such as VIA and research projects, attachment opportunities and mentoring by our teachers or industry/academia partners. The Student Development Programme includes the core CCE and student well-being programmes, a wide range of CCAs, enrichment and talent development programmes to broaden our students' world view and hone their unique strengths. The Instructional Programme provides a broad-based and rigorous foundation for post-secondary education. We implement academic enrichment programmes across to develop students' 21st century competencies. These include the Horizons Programme (overseas cultural immersion trip), Future Problem Solving Programme, Maths Olympiad and Science Talent Development programmes."
