		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "To prepare our students for the future, our programmes are designed to develop positive learning dispositions and nurture our students to become self-directed lifelong learners, with a passion for learning and the belief that they are able to make a meaningful contribution to the community and nation. We focus on creating authentic and meaningful learning experiences that will engage students, bring about a joy of learning and inculcate a passion for lifelong learning.  Our Applied Learning Programme (Languages) provides platforms for students to apply their language skills in authentic learning opportunities such as photojournalism and designing media messages to promote a social cause in real-life contexts.  Students with passion and talent are stretched through opportunities such as debates and emcees of events. We honour our students' individual traits and recognise the diverse talents and strengths of our students. Our Learning for Life Programme through the Arts caters to all students and focus on developing the aesthetic talents and creativity of students through exposure in Music, Performing Arts, Visual Art and Drama. To support our students in appreciating their strengths and shaping their aspirations, our ECG programme serves to guide and empower our students in making informed choices on their post-secondary education and future career endeavours. Students explore their interests by participating in Elective Modules and Advanced Elective Modules, and through interactions with practitioners from various industries during the school's annual Careers Day."
