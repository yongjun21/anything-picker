With a rich heritage as the oldest girls' school in the Far East, we receive strong support from the stakeholder community. Our partners' contributions range from sharing of experiences for career guidance and character development to offering placements for our Work Attachment Programme. The Development of Talents to Serve (DOTS) programme allows pursuit of passion and interests in various domains while benefitting the community. Our students achieve academic excellence through a rigorous curriculum that adopts a pedagogical framework utilising the elements of Critical Thinking to deepen student understanding and encourage inventive thinking; online platforms and school-developed mobile apps further enhance the learning experience. All students are developed in leadership skills and dispositions through a tiered leadership programme and are coached by their teachers to guide their growth. As the Cluster Centre of Excellence for Visual & Performing Arts, we are well-resourced with facilities such as an Art Studio & Gallery and Performing Arts Studio. Our engaging arts programme exposes students to varied art forms and experiences; they may also pursue the arts through the upper secondary Art, Drama or Enhanced Music programmes. Through a vibrant Character and Citizenship Education programme that actively involves our students in serving the community, the integration of values in the core & co-curriculum, the daily sharing of values and the Ethical Choices Programme, our students hone their socio-emotional competencies, imbibe sound values and learn to make ethical choices in life."
