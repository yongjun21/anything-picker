		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school sets out to prepare Queenstownians to be future-ready by equipping them with the mind-sets and skill-sets to navigate the uncertainties ahead. With this in mind, the school embarked on an Applied Learning Programme (ALP) which focuses on cultivating Disciplined and Synthesising Minds (based on Howard Gardner's 5 Minds for the Future) through investigative thinking. The emphasis is on the application of thinking skills, connecting knowledge across subject disciplines and applying these skills in authentic settings. The ALP lays a strong foundation in Queenstownians so that they will gain a competitive edge in the future. In line with the school's motto 'Dare to Serve', the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses on Community Youth Leadership (LLP-CYL). The LLP-CYL aims to anchor Queenstownians in self-leadership while nurturing them to become advocates for community needs. The National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) is a key platform to nurture personal leadership qualities such as self-discipline, resilience, integrity and also responsibility to the society and nation. A vast majority of Queenstownians will attain the NYAA Bronze Award, with many going on to pursue and achieve the Silver Award. LLP-CYL Packages and key programmes, such as the Values-in-Action Projects, the annual Quest Learning Festival and overseas immersion programmes, provide real-life learning experiences for Queenstownians to develop the skills and competencies necessary as a Community Youth Leader. Our other accolades include the sustained LOTUS Award for our extensive Green Efforts and the sustained achievements of our various CCA Groups. To promote the Joy of Learning and Innovation in our students, the school started the Makers' Club in 2017 to allow students to exercise their creativity and apply their design knowledge and skills. These programmes strive to nurture all Queenstownians as \"Leaders for Tomorrow, Anchored in Values, Committed to Serve\"."
