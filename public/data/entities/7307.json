Through direct teaching of key thinking competencies and application of mindfulness strategies, students are equipped with habits and skills for more effective learning; and to deal with challenges they may encounter with greater composure.  The school's signature Applied Learning Programme in Smart City and Assistive Technology is carried out with the support of IMDA and SG Enable.  This introduces students to sensor technology, electronics and coding in designing solutions to improve the lives of the elderly and disabled and to create a sustainable environment.  It is aligned to the school's values-focused orientation to empower students in contributing towards a compassionate and caring society. Another established niche of the school is its Learning through the Arts programme.  Student interest and skills in the aesthetics is developed through music, art and drama experiences in enrichment workshops; and performances at both school and public platforms. This serves to strengthen their capabilities for teamwork and confident self-expression. Those with the talent and passion can further develop themselves by joining our performing arts CCAs - all of whom have achieved SYF distinction standards.  Prestigious Mee Toh Foundation Arts Scholarships are awarded to students who are able to balance their studies with active contribution in artistic fields."
