			"The school believes in educating each child for life. It aspires to develop resilient children with joyful attributes of a growth mindset, a heart of appreciation and a sense of purpose; as well as to ground them in sound values that will withstand the test of time. We hope to develop confident life-long learners with the love for learning and have habits of a self-directed learner. We aim to provide opportunities for each child to become a caring leader, serving others and the community as well as play their part for the environment. ",
			"Towards this end, the school believes that it will 'take a village to raise a child'. In partnership with numerous partners, the school provides a unique Blangah Rise education experience customised to the needs of each child to maximise his or her potential. Ranging from outdoor experiences through the Southern Ridges located conveniently opposite the school, to having experiences of being an entrepreneur in Sentosa's Kidzflea, each child develops literacy, numeracy and 21st century skills to be future-ready. ",
			"The quality of the unique Blangah Rise experience will only be as good as the team of teachers who plans and delivers them. We believe in continually developing ourselves professionally to be skilful teachers who are caring and competent in what we do. And as a team we support and help each other in bringing out the best in us as well as our children. We thank our stakeholders for recognising our efforts through the numerous awards for inspiring teaching and innovation!"
