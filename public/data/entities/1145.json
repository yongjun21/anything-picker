			"To enable our students to learn successfully, we help them develop core habits to enhance effectiveness. This is done through the \"Leader in Me\" programme, which equips our students with Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Happy Kids for personal and inter-personal effectiveness. We design learning to meet the different learning needs of children through various programmes, including Aspiring Confident Engineers @ BRPS (Applied Learning Programme), Accelerated Programme to enhance Students' eXperience (APEX) (stretch programme), Chinese Junior Reporters and Young Photographers. We use service as a key platform to help our students apply learning and nurture connectedness with the school and the community, for example, through our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) for community and leadership which is anchored on environmental education.",
			"Through these programmes, we create a positive school experience for each student by nurturing their joy of learning, providing opportunities for all and developing a growth mindset in them. Our students become learners who are engaged, self-directed and have a love for learning. They also become leaders who are resilient and responsible, and care for self, others and the community."
