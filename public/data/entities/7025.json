		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school experience for our CHRians focuses on students knowing themselves during their Lower Secondary years and, as they progress to the Upper Secondary level, to continue to challenge themselves and strive towards building their dreams and contributing their best in all that they do. In building students' resilience and a can-do mindset, the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP)- \"Developing Social Emotional Learning Competencies through Outdoor Adventure Learning\" is key to drawing our students out of their comfort zones and helping them discover their potential to overcome their fears and limitations.  The school believes that the cumulative successes in overcoming challenges will help build their social emotional competencies, putting them on the road to facing life with determination and living an active lifestyle. The school provides students with the opportunity to apply academic knowledge learnt across disciplines to authentic situations in collaboration with Woodlands Healthcare Campus (WHC) through the Applied Learning Programme (ALP)- \"Developing 21st Century Competencies through an Inquiry Approach in Health Science and Technology\".  Using Design Thinking process in ALP, students acquire critical and inventive thinking dispositions, empathy and communications skills through which prepare them for the complexities and challenges faced in the era of innovation and uncertainty."
