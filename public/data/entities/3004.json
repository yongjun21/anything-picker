Beside a well-established 4-year O-Level programme, Cedar also offers the Integrated Programme (IP) under the Victoria-Cedar Alliance (VCA). Our IP students will complete 4 years of secondary education in Cedar before advancing to Victoria Junior College for the A-level curriculum. The VCA IP offers a seamless 6-year programme to students who enjoy independent study and exploratory work. They will have the opportunities to heighten their interest and passion through a challenging and enriched curriculum. In our mission to develop Leaders of Character, we have a comprehensive Character, Citizenship and Leadership Development Programme which inculcates the values, attributes and competencies desired of Cedarians in their journey through life. Cedar has received recognition in both the academic and co-curricular domains for its consistent performance and good teaching and learning processes. Graduating students each year have attributed their resilience to take on challenges, confidence in striking out and motivation to always give of their best to the developmental programmes offered by the school.",

Through this programme, students' innovative capacity is developed and honed to provide them with the vital skills they need to create breakthrough solutions to address authentic issues faced by the community. With the aim to broaden Cedarians' perspectives, the Beyond Borders Programme provides Cedarians the opportunity to explore learning beyond the shores of Singapore, see the world differently and learn to work collaboratively with local and international partners. Cedarians with special talents are given the opportunity to pursue their passions and interests through the Talent Development Programme. This programme aims to stimulate the students intellectually and cognitively to create new knowledge and stretch their potential."
