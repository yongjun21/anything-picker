We believe that education starts from home and continues in school. We see our parents as supportive partners who can play active roles in providing strong support to the school programmes in terms of time and resources. We communicate frequently with all parents to keep them informed of the school's events and programmes, teaching and learning focus and approaches. This allows the seamless transition of education from home to school and from school to home. ",
			"Over the years, the hard work and dedication of our staff and the strong support from our key partners have contributed to the success of many outstanding students who are not just academically talented, but more importantly, they have demonstrated themselves to be ladies of grace and character and leaders in their own field."
