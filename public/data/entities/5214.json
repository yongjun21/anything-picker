			"Grown from an initial student population of 300 in the founding year in 1951, Red Swastika School has established itself as a school recognised for its holistic education and emphasis  on character development anchored on the Xingzhi culture. ",
			"The Red Swastika School was founded by the World Red Swastika Society (Singapore Administration Centre), a charitable organization. As an extension of its charitable mandate and to achieve the noble objective of transforming people through education, the Society built a school on a site at Somapah Road in Changi. The over three acres piece of land was donated by the then President of the Society, Mr Quek Shin, who saw the need to provide free primary education for the poor and to aid in the promotion of education in the outlying areas. Originally known as \"Wan Tzu School\", the school was later renamed \"Red Swastika School\". The foundation stone was laid at the school opening ceremony on 13th January 1951. The school moved to the present site at Bedok North Avenue 3 in 1981 and became a Special Assistance Plan school in 1990.",
			"The school believes in the educational philosophy espoused by Mr Tao Xingzhi, a biculturally educated scholar commonly praised as the modern Confucius. Staff and students strive to build a Xingzhi Culture of \"Doing is the beginning of knowledge. Knowledge is perfected when the deed is completed. Do, so that you can know.  After you know, do it again.  Let your deed measure up to your knowledge.\" Students work towards being grounded in the strong values of Care, Magnanimity, Respect, Honesty, Resilience, Responsibility, Helpfulness, Leadership and Teamwork, to become the exemplary Three Littles- Little Friend, Little Master and Little Teacher."
