		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The QSS Experience provides varied programmes and opportunities to nurture every Queenswayan to become caring, responsible citizens and confident, life-long learners. QSS aims to develop in students the curiosity towards Science through inquiry-based approaches which develop thinking and collaborative skills and provides hands-on experience in research work. The Applied Learning programme, Future Learning Through Investigation, focuses on developing our students to be Queensway Investigators by developing in them the sense of wonder, sense of competency and sense of collaboration. They will get to experience building a Sea Perch and a series of Life Science investigations as part of the Tier 1 programme. For Tier 2, students can look forward to learn Arduino Programming, and visits to iFLY and Artscience Museum. We also have a distinctive Sports for Life and Outdoor Education Programme (SOE) as its Learning for Life Programme designed for building skills and competencies, developing character and values, and cultivating positive attitudes through active participation in sports and outdoor activities. The QSS Centre of Talent Development caters to students with special talents, and develops their distinct ability and passion. For instance, students with an aptitude in speaking, writing and critical thinking will be enrolled in our English Talent Development Programme where they could look forward to writing and speaking workshops, learning journeys, and entering local and international competitions. The school's Co-Curricular Activities, Character & Citizenship Education and Student Development & Leadership programmes have strong emphasis on character development, leadership, national education, community building and service. Students at each level are cared for and mentored by their Class Mentors and Year Heads who oversee their holistic development and work with school management to ensure effective delivery of student-centric, values-driven education."
