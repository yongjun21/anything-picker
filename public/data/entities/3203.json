		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Over the years, our students have performed well in their academics and the Co-Curriculum.  This is possible because our teachers nurture the whole child. Working in Professional Learning Teams, teachers build up their teaching-learning repertoire and stretch student capacity through carefully designed authentic learning activities, both within and beyond the classroom. Examples include engaging Science project work tasks at the lower secondary level, the use of manipulatives in Mathematics teaching, and Humanities Trails in the neighbourhood. Our students participate annually in competitions for Mathematics & Science and attend Advanced Elective Modules (with a science focus) at local polytechnics.  The school also champions reading literacy. In collaboration with the National Library Board, we have put in place a whole-school effort to promote reading as a habit among students."
