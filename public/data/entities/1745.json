			"In line with our philosophy 'Every child matters and deserves the best', we in Kranjj Primary believe that every student is a unique individual who has the capability to realise his potential and deserves to be provided with the opportunities, support and resources to do so. Guided by our core values of 'Responsibility to Serve, Compassion to Care, Integrity to Uphold and Perseverance to Pursue', students are committed to the Student's Creed - to be exemplary in character at all times, respect self and others, be responsible for their learning and actions, show care, uphold integrity and persevere in everything they do to achieve success.",
			"Our student management model is one of positive discipline. Every student learns to self-regulate and be mindful of the well-being of their peers, teachers and the environment.  A four-stage student leadership model allows for all students to serve as leaders.  They develop leadership capacity through taking on specific roles of higher responsibility in class, during Co-curricular Activities (CCA) and at the highest level, key student leadership positions.  ",
			"With a mix of students from different nationalities and races, we emphasise the moulding of gracious citizens with a deep sense of national identity; equipping them with cross-cultural awareness and communication skills. Building upon a dedicated staff and strong teacher-student rapport, we focus on nurturing critical thinking and social-emotional competencies. We strive to imbue in our students the character and disposition to excel in ways they never thought they could."

It adopts a whole-school approach to developing sports essentials such as broad-based skills and outdoor education at the lower primary levels. At the sports experience stage, those from P3 upwards are exposed to sports that include swimming and outdoor adventure camp. 'Play Cool Sports' offers students the option of learning a selection of sports such as archery, fencing, golf, inline-skating, self-defence and trampoline. Those who show a keen aptitude and attitude for our niche sports of Basketball and Football and emerging niches in Taekwondo and Wushu, receive targetted training to achieve sports excellence. Weaving through the LLP is VECCA (Values Education in CCA), a series of short structured lessons to instill core values."
