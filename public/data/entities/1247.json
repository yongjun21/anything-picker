			"At Bukit Timah Primary School (BTPS), we believe that every child has intrinsic worth. He/She can learn and achieve when given the right environment and support. Like a sapling, a child needs scaffolding to stay rooted while given the space to grow.  The right environment is a safe and conducive environment whereby order and discipline is put in place so that the child is able to learn well.  He/she is able to develop at his/her own pace and is given opportunities to explore, discover and ask questions. ",
			"To build a strong foundation in literacy, numeracy and thinking skills, teachers will provide the support and guidance.  By encouraging and caring for the pupils, they will be able to explore and excel. By the end of the 6 years of education at BTPS, our pupils will be motivated, independent and self-directed learners.  They would be developed in all the five domains: moral, aesthetics, physical, intellectual and social emotional."
