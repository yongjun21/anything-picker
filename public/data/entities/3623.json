		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP English Language) develops all students into Effective Communicators, Caring Leaders and Inventive Thinkers through a 3-year Communications Curriculum. Through Effective Reading, Debates and Presentations, students develop analytical, critical thinking, collaboration and oratorical skills. Talent development programmes such as the Model United Nations, e-Journalism and the Odyssey of the Mind, allow students to further hone their interest. From 2020, we are one of four schools offering the Enhanced ALP (Mother Tongue Languages). Over a 3-year curriculum, Chinese and Malay Language students are exposed to a range of experiences such as traditional medicine, public speaking, debates, creative compositions and song-writing, to develop a deeper appreciation of their Mother Tongue. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is a 4/5-year experience that focuses on Strengthening Resilience, Character and Leadership through Sports Education. We aim to nurture all students to become thinking and caring leaders who take personal responsibility for maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle. Students experience a broad-based PE curriculum and authentic applications of lessons on resilience and leadership through outdoor programmes, CCA and working with partners. A comprehensive 4-year Service Learning structure provides opportunities for students to engage with, and serve the community. This empowerment allows them to internalise values and sharpen leadership skills. The school also offers a structured Science and Technology Research Programme to stretch the potential of students with deep interest in Science, by providing them with opportunities to work on research projects under the guidance of dedicated teachers. Another feature of the school is its rich CCA experiences. With a variety of exciting and quality CCAs to choose from, students will find their schooling experience enriching and memorable."
