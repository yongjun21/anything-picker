Being one of the 6 Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan (SHHK) affiliated schools, it shares a common motto, Sincerity and Perseverance, with other SHHK schools. Upon relocation of its original premises to its current site in Yishun, it began offering all three Mother Tongue Languages, thereby paving the way for Singaporean children of all races to be part of the CFS education experience. Anchoring the pursuit towards holistic education are the school's values (expressed in the acronym GRACIOUSLY).",
