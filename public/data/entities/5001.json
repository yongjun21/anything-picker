		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) (ACSJ) is one of the seven units in the ACS Family of Schools. Bishop William Fitzjames Oldham founded Anglo-Chinese School on 1 March 1886 in a humble shop house at 70 Amoy Street. ",
			"Today, the ACSian outcomes in the domains of Aspiration (The ACSian embraces the future with an aspiring mindset), Character (The ACSian Gentleman of Character demonstrates love, integrity and loyalty at all times), and Service (The ACSian works with others to make a positive difference) are based on Christian values, which still remain as a cornerstone in the school's vision aims to make \"Every ACSian, a young gentleman of character ready for the future to lead and to serve\". ",
			"The school provides a positive learning environment designed to stimulate the intellectual, social, physical, emotional and spiritual growth of the boys. Through a shared vision and understanding of the school's core values (Integrity, Love, Excellence, Curiosity, Collaboration & Loyalty) there is strong engagement of the boys and staff in teaching and learning in both the core and co-curricular programme. ",
			"Central to our success at providing a holistic education for our students is the strong partnership we enjoy with our stakeholders and institutions in the wider community. At ACSJ, boys are part of a community that values each person's individual self-worth. They engage in meaningful activities while fostering firm friendships and ties that will last a lifetime.",
			"We believe that under our nurturing environment, and being amongst a caring and congenial community of staff, students, parents and alumni, a student's primary years with us will be both fulfilled and meaningful. Our students will leave the school as confident young gentlemen, ready to move on to greater heights in their next stage in life for above all they stand by our motto: The Best Is Yet To Be."
