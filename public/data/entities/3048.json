		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Hillgrove's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to raise students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) through the field of flight and aerospace (F&A). Students are engaged through various projects which develop their competencies such as confidence in communication and qualities such as entrepreneurial dare. They acquire real life knowledge and skills in the field of F&A and this heightens students' awareness of STEM-related careers. Hillgrove's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in the Arts seeks to develop students' understanding and appreciation of various arts forms. The programme nurtures confidence by providing platforms for students to articulate their creative ideas effectively. It comprises stand-alone modules as well as modules integrated into Art and Music lessons."
