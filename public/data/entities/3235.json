		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) fosters the joy of learning in Humanities and the English Language and cultivates in students 21st Century competencies including effective communication and collaboration skills, critical thinking, civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural understanding. The programme provides students with a diversity of Humanities subjects and opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills in tackling real world problems. This will deepen their appreciation of current affairs and global issues. Students can look forward to exciting authentic learning experiences such as fieldwork, overseas learning journeys and inter-disciplinary and Values-in-Action projects. Complementing our ALP is our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Music and Performing Arts. This broad- based programme is encapsulated as SHINE:  Self-discovery of interest and ability, Heritage & cultural appreciation, Interaction & Collaborative learning, eNgagement in community outreach & partnership and Excellence in artistic expression. Through cultural workshops, drama-in-curriculum classes, theatre experience, masterclasses, accreditation examinations and public performances, students cultivate sound values, social-emotional competencies, and pursue their passion and talent in the aesthetics. Level Camps (ONEIRIC, SPARK, METAMORPHOSIS, QUEST, CONQUEST) is another dedicated CCE programme that develops character and social emotional competencies in our students through powerful, experiential learning experience. The school also harnesses technology to support the curriculum in creating a more engaging learning environment for our students who are the digital natives. Students can expect enriched learning in our ALP and LLP, curricular and co-curricular programmes, such as Education and Career Guidance Programme and twinning programmes through our partnerships with Institutes of Higher Learning, community and government agency partners and overseas schools."
