		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Strong fundamental skills and values are at the centre of Zhenghua Secondary's endeavours. The school establishes a firm foundation for future learning by teaching core learning skills and instilling in our students a strong moral compass to face challenges with resilience and integrity. In academic learning, students are encouraged to take responsibility for their learning and be independent in the pursuit of knowledge. Problem-based and inquiry-based learning continue to be key teaching strategies to promote critical, creative and independent thinking. These efforts have yielded value-added outcomes.  We have a caring environment in which students and teachers have strong rapport. Our strong emphasis on holistic development is reflected in our unique Outdoor Education and Leadership programmes. We have an Adventure and Leadership Training Centre with facilities such as the high elements challenge ropes course and the outdoor and indoor rock walls. Outdoor education is infused in our PE programme. We are proud of the many achievements of our Uniformed Groups and Aesthetics groups. The school was conferred the Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in the Normal Course for our efforts in providing our students with meaningful learning experiences. We offer Direct School Admission (DSA) to suitable P6 students who demonstrate exemplary leadership competencies or who have excelled in their respective uniformed groups.",
