		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "To broaden the learning experiences of students, Jurongville Secondary School plans and implements an Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and a Learning for Life Programme (LLP). The school's ALP is 'Real-World Learning Through Electronics'. Through various authentic tasks, students learn and apply concepts relating to electronics. Lower secondary students, for instance, use their knowledge to design tools and equipment that can potentially be used to improve our quality of life. Upper secondary students who wish to deepen their knowledge can also choose to offer Electronics ('O' Levels) or Smart Electrical Technology ('N' Levels). With such early exposure to electronics, our students are more ready to consider STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) professional courses beyond secondary schools. "
