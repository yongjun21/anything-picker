		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The TJC 6-Year Integrated Programme provides a seamless progression of learning, empowering students beyond the basics by exposing them to both breadth and depth of knowledge, leading up to the GCE A-Level Examination in Year 6. The design of the 6-year IP curriculum  is integrative and interdisciplinary  with a clear focus on real world relevance. It  engenders in students greatness in intellect, character and leadership. Skills and Knowledge is a triad of modules instilling logical, critical and Design Thinking. This culminates in a Year 3 Innovation and Research Project where students use Design Thinking to create solutions for or innovate on different kinds of problems. IP students also have a plethora of programmes to whet their appetites and stretch them in their areas of interest.  The Temasek Academy Programme develops talented students in areas of Mathematics, Sciences, English and Chinese. Other talent areas include Sports (badminton, basketball and bowling), the Performing Arts (the Music Elective Programme and Concert Band) and Leadership. Moreover, there are signature cohort programmes - IP1 Experiential Learning Programme focussing on life skills, IP2 World without Borders with an ethnographic methodology and IP4 Wonder. Observe. Weave! attachments to external organisations. In addition, there are MOE Elective Programmes - Music Elective Programme (Year 1 to 6), Chinese Language Elective Programme (Year 3 to 6) and the Humanities Programme (Year 3 to 6). The Chinese Language Elective Programme aims to nurture promising students to attain a high level of language proficiency in Chinese, and enhance their understanding of literature."
