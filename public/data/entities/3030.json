		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Our school's distinctiveness is founded on four signature programmes; i) LEAD@TMS, ii) Cross-Cultural Awareness (C2A), iii) the Temasek Ignis Programme (TIP) and iv) niche CCA opportunities. LEAD@TMS offers student leaders the opportunity to develop values, competencies and knowledge through a customised student leadership programme. Based on their interests and talents, students are formally appointed into one of the five leadership groups where they plan and lead in various school-level and community-based activities. Additionally, to prepare them for a culturally diverse world, all student leaders are developed in C2A which deepens their understanding and appreciation of other cultures. C2A is also made available to all lower secondary students via Project Culture which piques their curiosity to explore the similarities and differences between local cultures, as well as Camp Culture, which enables students to delve deeper into cultural issues after visiting various religious sites. TIP is the school's talent development programme which caters to students with strong intellectual curiosity and personal drive. With the purpose to develop independent learners, confident thinkers and innovators, 'TIPpers' are stretched to further hone their academic skills and student leadership ability. Finally, school distinctiveness is also captured through our four niche CCAs - Canoeing, Shooting, Drama and Choir, which aim to nurture talents in sports and the aesthetics; in the process, instilling a sense of commitment, self-reliance and a spirit of service to others."
