		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School (Primary) is a school with a strong Methodist heritage and history.  Two tenets: holistic development and character development form the foundation of learning at PL. ",
			"As espoused by the school philosophy and guided by our first tenet on holistic development, the school develops the girls into well-rounded, whole persons. At PL, we nurture our students in the cognitive, leadership, aesthetics, physical and social-moral domains. Besides exposing the students to varied learning experiences, this holistic development also helps the girls find their strengths and grow their interest. Aligned to our second tenet, character development, the school nurtures PL-Lites to become women after God's HEART - Honour God, Excellence Mindset, Adaptable, Respect and Thankful. ",
			"Undergirding these two tenets is the key emphasis on the use of experiential learning. PL teachers design authentic settings for learning so that our girls will grow to become Confident Leaders, Global Citizens and Creative Problem-solvers. ",
			"Together with the Board, Alumni, Parents and PLMGS (Sec), the school builds a strong culture which we name the PL Spirit. This PL Spirit fosters a strong school identity and safe learning environment which enable the girls to blossom as they grow under the care of their teachers and love of their peers."
