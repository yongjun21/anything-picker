Our staff and students are guided by our school motto Nil Sine Labore (Nothing Without Labour) in the pursuit of performance excellence. The Victorian Spirit, the sense of pride and belonging to the school, encapsulates the camaraderie, fighting spirit and desire by every Victorian to be the best that he can be. VS is a dual-track school offering the 4-year 'O' level Programme, and the 6-year Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme (VCA IP) developed jointly with Cedar Girls' Secondary School (CGSS) and our affiliated college, Victoria Junior College (VJC). Every Victorian will be developed in character and leadership, in the cognitive, physical and aesthetics domains, and in service to the community. Through a broad-based rigorous curriculum and an inviting school environment that fosters thinking, creativity and teamwork, our Victorians are nurtured into young gentlemen who are upright and balanced leaders.",
