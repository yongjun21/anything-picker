		"School Mission": "Through a dynamic school culture and a caring environment, every student is nurtured and his/her potential developed so that he/she grows up to be a good person and useful citizen.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"At Zhenghua Primary School, we are guided by our motto 'The Best That We Can Be' and our philosophy that 'Every child can learn and is capable of achieving his/her personal best'.  We offer a student-centric, values-driven education with opportunities for talent development. ",
			"The notion 'Students Our Focus, Staff Our Key' continues to be the nucleus of the school culture framework.  We believe in providing a caring, inclusive and positive school environment for all.  Through a culture of care, students are guided by values to do the right things.  Through a culture of learning, students are motivated to learn, to give their personal best, and to hone their 21st century competencies.  Through a culture of innovation, students will learn to be inquisitive, imaginative and see interconnections.  The culture of collaboration allows our students to build team values, hone their social-emotional skills and learn to give back to the community. ",
			"The spirit of life-long learning is imbued deeply in our staff.  Our staff has embarked on the Professional Learning Community journey since 2010 where professional discourse takes place on a weekly basis to encourage reflection and innovative practices.  Lesson Study is one of the tools used by teachers to analyse the effectiveness of learning and teaching.  We aim to inculcate a habit of graciousness with the ability to appreciate the finer aspects of life through active engagement in the aesthetics and sports.  Our Learning for Life Programme 'Aesthetics Appreciation through Dance Arts Education' serves to provide students with a variety of exposure and opportunities to experience quality arts programmes.  The school believes in establishing strong partnerships with key stakeholders and the community, both local and global, to enhance the overall quality of education.  We strongly believe that 'It takes a whole village to raise a child'.  At ZHPS, we walk the journey together with every child."
