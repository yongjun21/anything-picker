As an all-boys school, we adopt a boy-centred approach focussing on sports, outdoor education, the Sciences and ICT in our school-wide programmes, whilst supporting individual interests of Marists, to bring out the best in them. We further inculcate our school motto of Diligence, Determination, Loyalty and Dedication, and Courage, and Marist Values in Marists, so that they are equipped with the attitudes and competencies to become contributing members of society. Caring teachers and strong programmes geared towards building school spirit anchor the learning experiences of Marists.",
