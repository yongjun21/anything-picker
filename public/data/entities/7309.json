		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Founded in 1888 by a missionary, Miss Sophia Blackmore, Fairfield provides a holistic education based on Christian values. Believing that God places students in our school for a special reason, we help students develop their talents and nurture the Fairsian Outcomes of wisdom, personhood, commitment to community and heart of service. The Fairfield curriculum is undergirded by the WHEEL philosophy to provide Fairsians with holistic, enriched and experiential learning. We strongly believe that education should go beyond the syllabuses--that students should explore beyond the classroom and be engaged in meaningful and authentic experiences in order that deep learning can occur. The Fairfield curriculum also seeks to develop a strong personal voice in our student leaders so that they can exert a gracious and positive influence on the community.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The Fairfield Learning EXperience (FLEX) week is a signature programme which exposes students to various aspects of holistic education outside the classroom: Social Awareness, Outdoor Education, Values-in Action and Educational & Career Guidance. The school also prepares students to speak with confidence both in English as well as their Mother Tongue through the Voice of a Fairsian Oracy Programme. Besides learning to be effective communicators, students develop a personal voice with which they articulate, persuade and convince others. The Inter-disciplinary River Studies Project and Community Problem-Solving Project also enable our students to develop academic thinking and skills. Our Character & Citizenship Education Programme, weekly Chapel and daily devotions emphasise values and equip students with important lifeskills. To bring about a student-led school, the Sophia Blackmore Leadership Programme trains all students to lead themselves and influence their peers. More specific and specialised training is also provided to advance the leadership competencies of student leaders."
