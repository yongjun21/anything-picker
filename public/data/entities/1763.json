Thus our motto 'Excel with Character' is communicated to our students and they subscribe to the fact that even as they excel in other areas, it must be with good character, and if they excel in other areas, but are not of good character, then everything comes to naught.",
			"We have 4 school values to guides our students in developing their character : Care, Integrity, Resilience and Responsibility. We want our students to be kind and show consideration for others, to be honest and truthful, to remain strong and never give up even in the face of challenges and setbacks, and to have the responsibility to take the initiative to act independently and do the right thing."
