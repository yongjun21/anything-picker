		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "In Xinmin, we strive to prepare our students well for further learning and the future world of work by developing them into leaders of hearts and minds. We develop 21st Century Competencies (21CC) in our students through our thoughtfully designed curriculum and a tiered approach to provide learning experiences that would cater to students' different interests and readiness levels. Some of our key school-based curriculum include (i) Coding@Xinmin, which develops students' computational thinking through coding; (ii) RefleXions@Xinmin, our lower secondary Drama programme which builds our students' self-confidence, ability to empathise and understanding of the human condition; (iii) XinminCares, our sustained values-in-action programme which offers students opportunities to contribute to the community and develop important life skills; and (iv) our Student Leadership Academy that provides authentic learning opportunities to groom our students as leaders who will go on to make a difference to the school and their community. These key programmes are embedded within an enriching learning environment that incorporates a games-based approach to develop core 21CC like critical and inventive thinking; harness the affordance of technology to enhance students' learning, develop them as responsible online citizens, and as collaborative and self-directed learners (e.g., through the Flipped Classroom pedagogy); and emphasises knowledge application in real life."
