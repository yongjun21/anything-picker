The millennial student will be one who is independent and yet interdependent.  To achieve this aim, the school's Programme for Active Learning (PAL) offers learning experiences to develop soft skills in our students such as the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others, and instil the belief in their abilities to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge.  At the upper levels, the Interdisciplinary Project Work focuses on real-life problems to help students make sound decisions based on assessing various alternatives. Such learning transcends teaching from textbooks. "
