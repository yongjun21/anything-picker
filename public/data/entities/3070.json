In Sec 2, in the Clean Energy module, a collaboration among Science, Geography and Design & Technology, students explore various types of clean energy. Beyond these modules, outstanding students also pursue their interest through learning journeys and competitions. Learning for Life Programme in Community and Youth Leadership is where meaningful service learning projects are given to students of all levels to live the school values of Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity and Self-Respect and work towards developing into the 21st Century jun zi (gentleman and lady). Sec 1 students would draw up proposals to improve the school environment; Sec 2 students work with external agencies on projects; Sec 3 students initiate service learning activities locally and Sec 4/5 students advocate for a social cause.
