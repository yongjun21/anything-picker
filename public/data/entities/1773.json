		"School Vision": "To nurture pupils so that they can excel in their pursuits and contribute to the society, through providing a holistic education and a dynamic learning environment.",
		"School Mission": "Passionate Learners,Caring Leaders, Global Citizens",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"Tanjong Katong Primary started in 2001 as an amalgamation of 3 schools, Fowlie Primary(a result of an earlier merger between Fowlie and Seraya Schools), Haig Boys' and Mountbatten Primary Schools. In its earlier years, Tanjong Katong Primary was well-known for its higher proportion of international students. Even up till today, the school continues to boast of a student population that comes from diverse backgrounds in terms of their nationality and ethnicity. Since TKP opened its doors, it has made a name for itself with the all-round, balanced education it provides as well as the caring culture within the TKP community.",
			"In TKP, we believe that every child is different and each comes with his/her unique talents and needs. As such, we are committed to nurturing each of them to fulfil his/her potential. We hope that through providing a holistic education that develop our students in the various domains, they will have opportunities to discover their strengths. We also hope that they would also be exposed to ways in which they can use what they have learnt to benefit others.",
			"Our new vision, 'Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders, Global Citizens', is an expression of aspiration for our students so that they will be prepared and equipped for the VUCA world and the future ahead.  We strive to provide a dynamic learning environment so that our students may develop a love of learning, not just learning during their schooling years but into their life, long after they have left school. We nurture them so that they could excel in their pursuits. When they succeed in life, we hope that they would have empathy and care about others; and contribute back to the society. We would also like to continue to tap on the unique profile of the students to cultivate the cross-cultural skills essential for them to thrive in a globalised world.",
			"To this cause, we will work with our partners, including parents, alumni and the community, to enrich the learning experiences of our students."
