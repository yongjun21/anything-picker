With a 91-year history, Serangoon Secondary School has produced many illustrious alumni. Known as  StaRs, Serangoon students are nurtured holistically through comprehensive programmes designed to develop each child's talents and aspirations and enable him to excel holistically. The joy of learning is made possible with innovative teaching methodologies coupled with real life applications that include approaches such as that of Inquiry-based in Science and the Integrated Coursework in Craft and Technology. Our students are also provided with rich and diverse learning experiences both locally and overseas. Recognising students for their talents and efforts goes beyond achieving accolades and this has become an integral part of our culture. Upper Secondary students can also strive for the Serangoon StaR Awards for overall excellence in various areas. We value our partners and we value partnerships to augment our efforts to enhance student learning. The Parent Support Group is actively involved in providing support, engaging parents, and networking to enrich students' learning. The school also offers Computing and Mobile Robotics as Elective Subjects offered for those who take a special interest in these areas. Our students hone their leadership skills in working for the good of the community through our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Project Ablaze: Harnessing Youth Leadership in the Service of Community. We also ensure our students are future ready, through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Real-world Explorations in ICT.  Above all we are committed to ensuring that our StaRs SHINE through inculcating our core values of Self-directedness, Harmony, Integrity, Resilience and Excellence.",
