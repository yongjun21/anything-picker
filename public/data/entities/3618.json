		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Regent delivers a comprehensive curriculum with customised programmes to support the varied learning needs and interests of our students. In the instructional programme, Assessment for Learning (AfL) strategies are adopted as a school-wide teaching and learning approach to develop our students to be self-directed. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is supported by the Science Centre and serves as a platform to guide and expose our students in the area of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) which they learn to appreciate the relevance and value of what they learn in the academic curriculum. Students will have the opportunity to build an Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) from scratch while learning to work in teams. This builds up students' skills in thinking, self-directing, problem-solving and decision-making. In Secondary 2, they will be taught coding and they will attempt to apply it on their ROV. Secondary 3 students are exposed to a wider range of STEM industries via Learning Journeys, Elective Modules and Advanced Elective Modules. In addition, Regent's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) adopts a whole-school approach to develop student's character, leadership and spirit for volunteering. The approach is achieved through our school's Student Leadership Programme and the Values-in-Action Programme (for youth volunteerism development). The Student Leadership programme equips our students with the attitude, knowledge and skills to lead self, peers and community. The Values-in-Action programme provides our students with the platforms and opportunities to take action and make a difference in school and community. Other enrichment programmes provided include the Mathematics & Science Olympiad. We are increasing opportunities for students to initiate VIA activities so that our students will be able to lead change in causes they are passionate about."
