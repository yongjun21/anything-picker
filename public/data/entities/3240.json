		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Zhonghua's signature programmes are integrated under 3 broad strands of education, namely: Science and Technology Education, Environmental and Sustainability Education and Glocal Perspective Education. Zhonghua is the South Zone Centre of Excellence for Science and students across all levels are given opportunities to discover the wonders of Science and its applications through experiential and student-centred learning activities. In addition, all lower secondary students go through the Design Thinking process to develop a problem-solving mindset. Riding on the push for STEM education, the STEAM Research Programme provides opportunities for our students to work on real world problems and equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values for the future workplace. Our Robotics and Computing Programme and Data Literacy module further develop our students in terms of creativity, programming and analytical skills. For Environmental and Sustainability Education, we seek to nurture our students to be future-ready leaders who reflect and research on the challenges that the world faces through experiential and collaborative learning experiences beyond the classroom. Our MOE Art Elective Programme (AEP) adopts the Lincoln Centre Education approach that develops students' capacities for imagination and enables them to realise their artistic potential through a rigorous 4-year programme. Complementing this, the Glocal Perspective Education nurtures students to be cultured, caring and global citizens through a range of cultural activities and global immersion opportunities. The Student Leadership Programme nurtures forward-looking leaders with integrity and commitment to serve the school, community and nation and provides tiered leadership training and experiences to all students. Our Talent Development Programme also provides programmes tailored to stretch the potential of selected students."
