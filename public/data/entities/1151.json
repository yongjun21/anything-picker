		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"At Mayflower Primary School, we believe that the purpose of education is to prepare every child for the real world. Hence, the school recognises the importance of building a strong, broad-based education that opens up students' horizons and exposes them to varied, holistic learning experiences. Success goes beyond academic achievements as we help our pupils pursue their dreams by capitalising on their strengths, interests and talents. We strive to engage each child to discover what makes school and learning worth their time, energy and effort, thereby inspiring them to take greater ownership of their learning. ",
			"The school aspires to build a culture of care, excellence, openness and trust. A learner is motivated to excel when there are clear, high expectations set and high levels of support provided. Setting high standards serves to keep learners engaged in a challenging task. It also enhances their confidence and self-esteem when the goals are achieved. High expectations should be accompanied by high levels of support so as to minimise frustration and abortion of plans due to early failures. Teachers are key to effective pupil learning.  We are committed to building a team of caring and excellent educators who believe in bringing out the best in each child. We place premium on establishing quality teacher-student relationships, thereby creating a safe, conducive and vibrant environment for learning. Our teachers are role models of lifelong learning who continually re-examine their professional practice and keep abreast of educational trends and development.",
			"Nurturing the whole child is a shared responsibility between the school and family and we seek to build a strong partnership with parents to bring out the best in each child."
