The SCGS IP provides an exceptional blend of excellence in academic and leadership development. It focuses on cultivating intellectual resilience and ethical leadership while facilitating the pursuit of possibilities. Our vibrant and collaborative learning community prepares students to meet challenges and inspires them to be Principled Leaders of Tomorrow. It comprises four key components: Core Academic, World Readiness and Character & Leadership Excellence Programmes and Passion Pursuit. We also offer a Bicultural Studies Programme which nurtures our girls' bicultural awareness and enhances their mastery of the Chinese Language. IP students will spend their first 4 years in SCGS before progressing to Eunoia Junior College to complete the IP. Students in the O-Level Programme enjoy an enriched experience that nurtures world-ready leaders of character and relevance. The Talent Development Programme provides opportunities for students to achieve excellence in their areas of interest, for example, through local/ overseas field trips, enhanced project work and mentorship programmes with local scientists. The Character and Leadership Excellence Programme covers World Readiness, Social Entrepreneurship and Environmental Responsibility through platforms such as Outdoor Education Camps, Overseas Trips, SC Model United Nations and Leading Youths in Research & Inquiry into Community & Society."
