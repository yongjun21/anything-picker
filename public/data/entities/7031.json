		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "HAIsians are inspired to surpass boundaries and learn skills and competencies to thrive in the future. We offer two distinctive programmes i.e., the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, and the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Student Leadership.  For the ALP, our students go through teacher-designed lessons that explore modern, cutting edge ideas in STEM such as Artificial Intelligence in Industry 4.0 and foundations of applied science, programming and mathematics.  The ALP culminates in its second year, where students are taught design thinking approaches to understand real life problems in the community and experience working with high-tech equipment to design, build and rebuild prototype solutions. Through the ALP, students also develop values and life-skills such as empathy, grit, collaboration and entrepreneurial dare.  Our LLP takes students on a journey to understand themselves better and to exercise leadership in different situations through involvements within and beyond school.  As a community that leads, care and serves, our students are nurtured into charitable, compassionate and gracious individuals who do small things with great love, and contribute positively to the school and the external community.  Our other key signature programmes include the HAI Experiential Week and the Internationalisation Programmes.  As a school founded by the Franciscans, we also emphasise development of life habits such as waste reduction that sustain the environment and the earth."
