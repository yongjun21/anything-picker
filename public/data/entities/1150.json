			"In AMKPS, we believe that the Purpose of education is not to prepare our students for life in the future, but for life in the present as well. Hence, the sum of experiences of in the AMKP curriculum does not solely serve academic preparations for progression to the stage of formal education or for economic contribution, but also includes teaching our students how to take care of their own personal development and being a civil member of the community and a concerned citizen for the country.",
			"In AMKPS, we believe that all students have the Potential and Desire to learn. They want to learn more about themselves, more about the world and how they can better relate to the world. All students can learn. Yet every child is unique in his/her interests, perspective of the world around them, hopes and aspirations. Hence, it is important to hear the child's voice, and when we begin to recognize and appreciate it, we can better engage the child to care for, guide and inspire him/her.",
			"In AMKPS, we believe in the Provision of equitable access to quality learning experiences for all students, regardless of their background. Based on the different students' readiness levels, we must provide multiple methods and approaches by which students may benefit from diverse learning experiences, and experience success in various domains.",
			"Based on these 3 core beliefs about the Purpose of Education, Potential of Learners, and Provision of Equitable Access, we have conceptualized the AMKP Experience Wheel which is driven 5 critical success factors. They are:",
			"a) Values Integration ",
			"b) Voice & Ownership",
			"c) Quality Relationship",
			"d) Opportunities for All",
			"e) Growth Mindset",
			"These 5 factors interact and influence the design of all learning programmes and experiences in AMKPS to develop within our students important Leadership Habits which form the set of desired student behavioural outcomes to help them become young leaders who are self-directed learners and morally upright citizens."
