		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP), 'Exploring Health Sciences and Sports Sciences' aims to deepen students' knowledge and develop their interest in the Health domains (e.g. General Physiology and Nutrition). During the ALP lessons, students learn to apply the skills and knowledge learned to enhance their individual well-being and that of others. In addition, learning journeys and attachments to health science related companies are arranged for the students to experience and understand the challenges, needs and expectations of healthcare professionals. The school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP), 'GEARing Springfielders for Success', seeks to nurture students to be socially responsible and develop in them a spirit of volunteerism to make a difference to the community. Through the school's LLP which focuses on Community and Youth Leadership (CYL), the school designs learning experiences for students to acquire a critical set of skills and knowledge related to CYL. This is done through purposeful partnerships with the community partners to provide opportunities for students to transfer their learning and put into practice the skills learned."
