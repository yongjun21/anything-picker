			"Canossa Convent Primary School (CCPS) is an all-girls catholic school that delivers Canossian Education which anchors in the formation of the whole person. The Canossian education emulates the work and spirit of our foundress St Magdalene of Canossa to serve the poorest of the poor. It is inclusive and embraces persons of all faiths and races and those with special needs. The Canossian education emphasizes on the formation of the heart to anchor our pupils in values especially to instil in our pupils the spirit of serving the poor.",
			"In line with the Canossian Education of building a whole person, CCPS aims to develop our pupils to be passionate learners who are self-directed and resilient and compassionate leaders who serve with humility. CCPS graduands will be leaders of character who live the Canossian Identity which encompasses the school values of 3Cs (Commitment, Compassion and Cheerfulness). ",

The various sectors in the Canossian Eduplex share a common belief in the care of the child and work closely with one another to provide the love, care and education needed for the holistic development of the child."
