Students are empowered to plan and implement charity drives for their financial needy peers, health-enhancing and well-being programmes for senior citizens and other social leadership activities for the wider community. The second distinctive programme for PCSS, the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Food, Health and Sports Science aims to expose Peicaians to experiential learning in food processing, food technology, fitness, lifestyle and healthcare. Together with our student leadership framework, we hope to mould Peicaians of Character who truly live up to the school vision of Critical Minds, Compassionate Hearts. PCSS offers Direct School Admission (DSA) to Primary 6 students who have a deep belief and passion in leadership and are keen to serve as Student Leaders in PCSS."
