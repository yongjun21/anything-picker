		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "At the heart of WGS Education is the intent for students to have a wide range of learning opportunities in the cognitive, aesthetics and physical domains so as to realise their talents and broaden their interests. Students are developed to be logical and analytical thinkers as well as creative, imaginative and artistic individuals. The school's strengths in design, environmental education and the performing arts, provide students with a strong foundation to pursue their individual pathways. A spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship is fostered within the school and students are taught to value teamwork, question assumptions and to respect differing views. The school also strives to engage the hearts of its students, developing in them a passion to serve. Partnerships are forged to connect students to the local community so as to nurture civic responsibility. Internships with external organisations prepare and equip students to deal with future challenges with confidence and determination.",
