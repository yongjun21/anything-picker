		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "In Beatty Secondary, where students' aspirations matter, we aim to develop students' talents, stretch their potential and prepare them for the future. Through the various in and out-of-classroom opportunities and experiences, we develop students to become critical thinkers, innovative problem solvers, effective leaders and future-ready citizens with a global outlook. Anchored on strong values, we equip them with essential social skills and competencies. Our Applied Learning Programme, 'Beattyians Think. Create. Innovate' enables Beattyians to develop 21st Century Competencies and apply them in real-life contexts. In line with Singapore's Smart Nation vision, the programme allows students to develop digital literacy (basic programming and coding language) through computing knowledge, paving the way for them to embrace future digital challenges in a VUCA world. Design Thinking tools and processes are used to teach students to identify the specific needs of the target group, define problems, ideate and propose viable solutions. Our Learning for Life Programme, 'Beatty's Leaders for Life Programme' grooms exemplary and purposeful leaders through the Kouzes and Posner's Leadership Challenge model. With the myriad platforms in place, students bloom as confident and effective communicators. Through overseas cultural exchange programmes with schools from Japan, China and Vietnam, students gain deeper insights into other parts of the world beyond the shores of Singapore. Our Character Development Programmes, which include Outdoor Adventure Camps and Values-in-Action programmes serve to imbibe sound values, develop strength of character and socio-emotional competencies in Beattyians."
