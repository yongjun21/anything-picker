		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Toy Story is one of the school's distinctive programmes.  It aims to develop pupils' critical and inventive thinking skills through toy design.  Our pupils are taught thinking skills such as Edward de Bono's 6 Thinking Hats and are encouraged to ask questions as they gather information to help them in their tasks.  The process of questioning and clarification leads to the discovery of science concepts and reinforces their learning from the Science syllabus.  They will also reflect and work on improvements to their toys based on peer and teacher reviews.  Our pupils have the opportunity to contribute in consensus building and group decisions and build their confidence in small group settings.  "
