Hence, the focus on the culture of care. ",
			"School emphasizes Leading by Caring, and this philosophy is integrated into our Student Leadership Programme where the P5 and 6 students demonstrate care by initiating projects and programmes for the juniors, for example the P6 students organize the yearly CCA Open House for P1 and 2 students. Students and staff, in turn, are inspired to strive for improvement as we care for self and others."
