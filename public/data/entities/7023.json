		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "CHIJ St. Theresa's Convent is a Catholic mission school started in 1933 in response to an urgent need to provide an education for the daughters of poor workers at the Harbour, Hospital and Railway in the Tanjong Pagar area.  Today, the school remains true to its mission to provide a quality education for all, with special reference to persons who are disadvantaged in any way.  The Theresian Brand of education seeks to equip our students with knowledge, skills and values for life, not just for examinations.  We believe that education must develop the Theresian student to go beyond self to serve others in the community.  The design and delivery of our curriculum is therefore guided by the Integral Pedagogy Process which starts with the Context of the learner, taking her through Experience and Reflection to Action and Evaluation.  It is only in action that the Theresian demonstrates learning and service to others.",

Our programmes are grounded in the school's belief in holistic education through experiential learning.  Unique to CHIJ St. Theresa's Convent are our two Distinctive Programmes, \"Education for Life (EFL):  Developing Portable Skills through and for Real World Problem Solving\" and \"Developing Self-Directed, Confident and Resilient Leaders, Learners and Ladies through Sports and Hockey\".  We have customised our Values Education curriculum to align to the school's mission, vision and values and MOE's CCE learning outcomes.  The school employs school-wide teaching strategies to address the different learning needs of students, with the aim of heightening engagement during lessons.  Amongst the many approaches used are Integral Pedagogy Process, Cooperative Learning, Inquiry-Based Learning and Problem-Based Learning."
