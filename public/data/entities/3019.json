		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school had developed various in-house flagship curricular programmes and distinctive programmes. Our flagship programmes such as Multi-Modal Reading Programme, Y-Venture (Mathematics), Interdisciplinary Scientific Exploratory and Experiential Learning and the Conversational Chinese/Malay Programme aim to make learning visible and engender engagement in learning. Complementing the curriculum is our Applied Learning Programme in coding, design thinking and robotics (CODER) to help Yuhuans develop thinking skills and apply knowledge in authentic settings. Our Learning-for-Life Programme MELODY (Music-Empowered Learners, Our Dynamic Yuhuans) harnesses our long-standing tradition of musical excellence to nurture the attributes of creativity, precision, teamwork, discipline and confidence in Yuhuans. The music curriculum allows Yuhuans to experience diverse genres of music and showcase their talents at various platforms. Musically talented Yuhuans can also offer GCE O Level Music under the Enhanced Music Programme. Electronics and Mobile Robotics were introduced as applied subjects to broaden Yuhuans' learning experiences. Yuhuans will acquire skills and knowledge in the fundamentals of electronics and fields of mechatronics engineering through experiential and practice-based learning. Yuhuans are exposed to STEM-related Elective Modules and Advanced Elective Modules offered by tertiary institutions."
