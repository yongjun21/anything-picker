As a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school, CHS is grounded in the philosophy of bilingualism and biculturalism. As a Catholic mission school, love is the motivation behind all our actions. We ensure there is Joy of Learning in school life, and that students develop a Mindset of Excellence. The school's core values underpin every member's attitude, actions and aspirations. Our heritage, alumni and parent support group are the strengths that our school draws upon for our model of education, where every student is a Leader, Gentleman and Bilingual Scholar in the making. Offering the unique dual-track model with both the O-Level and Integrated Programmes (IP), the CHS experience offers a curriculum strong in academic distinction, leadership and character development, and sports and aesthetics excellence. Our IP students will spend their first 4 years in CHS before progressing to Eunoia Junior College to complete the IP.",
