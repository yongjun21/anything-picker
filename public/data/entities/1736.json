		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"In Tampines North Primary School, our students enjoy their learning in a nurturing and supportive environment and look forward to coming to a school where every child matters. Guided by its mission to instil a lively curiosity and graciousness in every pupil, the school leverages and collaborates with its key stakeholders and the community to achieve its vision of becoming a school that inspires individuals to be their best. ",
			"The school focuses on the holistic development of students through its total curriculum, building the capacity of staff as the key driver to impact on students' learning and creating a meaningful and unique learning experience where students experience success, deepen their interests and enhance their performance. We believe that it is important for our students to experience success in the early stage of learning. Positive reinforcement and opportunities to celebrate success enable them to gain confidence in their abilities and develop their interest to want to learn more. More importantly, we want to inspire our students to be their best to realise their potential.",
			"To promote the well-being of its students and help them better manage the various demands in their learning journey, the school has put in place processes and programmes to meet students' varied needs at different stages of their learning. Besides the instructional programme, it leverages its non-academic programmes such as Environment Education, its Learning for Life Programme (LLP),  Performing Arts and PAL to develop students' talents, character and social emotional competencies. ",
			"In TNPS, students can look forward to a fulfilling and enriching learning experience in their primary education."
