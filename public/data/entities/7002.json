The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP), SPEAK (SPeak English with grAce and Knowledge), aims to develop a love and appreciation for the English Language, and hone students' language ability so that they are effective and proficient users of the language. Through the ALP, students will gain mastery of the language through specialised training such as poetry and drama, debate, drama and public speaking, with opportunities to apply their skills through competitions, events and attachments.  The school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) aims to nurture and inspire students who are committed to serve their communities with empathy. Students will be exposed to authentic experiences of community issues and needs and empowered to make positive differences to the lives of others."
