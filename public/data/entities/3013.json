We are committed to nurturing leaders in the character, academic and arts domains. In doing so, we believe in students learning the value of stewardship, where the best and the brightest TKGians must lead through 'noble service' to 'serve with honour', as inspired by the school song penned by the first principal Ms Maude Scott in 1953. Our aspiration for being a school of distinction must start from within, where every girl who comes through our doors would understand the obligations and responsibilities in upholding a tradition of excellence which we have built over 65 years.",
