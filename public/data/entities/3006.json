		"School Mission": "Our school is a community that nurtures the best in each and strives ever ONWARD.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "The school strongly believes in providing a quality student experience that will enable all Gessians to become innovative thinkers, collaborative learners, principled leaders, and who are love embodied, fulfilling the four aspects of our Gessian portrait. We believe that education in the 21st century is about nurturing the whole person whose actions are guided by the school mission of nurturing the best in each student to strive ever ONWARD. The school nurtures an environment where every student and staff member is valued, encouraged and empowered to excel, learn and care for others, and where their accomplishments are celebrated. The school designs a wide range of academic and student development programmes to provide students with both formal and informal learning opportunities. The school's CCE curriculum engages the students' heads, hearts and hands, as every student will go through programmes such as level camps and community and youth leadership events that focus on developing self-mastery skills and contributing to the community. From 2020, the school is also a pilot school for the Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) programme, which offers greater customisation of learning based on students' subject-specific strengths and interests. This is aligned with our founder's vision of enabling students of all backgrounds and abilities to learn and grow as a community.",

Students discover themselves and develop a better appreciation of one another's uniqueness. They also learn effective strategies to leverage their strengths and build competencies in other areas, and collaborate with others. The GESS LIFE programme will provide school-wide, cohort and personal opportunities for every student to purposefully apply his/her knowledge and skills to impact the school and community. The GESS Applied Learning Programme, titled GESS Probes*, aims to develop future work skills such as transdisciplinarity, design thinking, and novel and adaptive thinking. Students will learn the Design Thinking process, as well as Arduino or Microbit programming in the course of their investigations, which centre on environmental themes such as water conservation and the reduction of our carbon footprint."
