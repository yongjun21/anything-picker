		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"In Horizon Primary, we believe that every child is a confident individual who is able to grow and become a responsible citizen. Horizon's driving force is garnered from 3 significant areas; our learning environment, our philosophy of our students and the people who realise the School Vision.",
			"Our learning environment is one that focuses on providing a wide range of learning platforms for holistic development. Thus the learning experiences are designed to grow a child holistically addressing the 5 domains - Moral, Cognitive, Physical, Social and Aesthetics. We aspire to develop in every child good character and nourish his or her intellectual, social and emotional well-being. This is accomplished through daily learning experiences and joyful activities offered through the I-LEAD curriculum, Safe Play@ Horizon, Leaders' Trail in Biodiversity, P5 Computational Thinking in Mathematics, sessions, Making Thinking Visible routines based Aesthetic lessons, Design Thinking for P4 Project Work, language acquisition efforts and a range of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA). ",
			"As our philosophy is that 'Every Child a Leader', we focus strongly on character building and leadership development. I-LEAD is our leadership development programme for all students based on Steven R. Covey's 7 Habits and the school's values- Respect, Integrity, Compassion and Excellence. The curriculum allows students to learn, practise and inculcate the 7 Habits and the school values through their daily learning experiences to become self-leaders.",
			"The strong pillars of Horizon's vibrant learning environment are our staff and parents.  As a dedicated staff community, we strive to ensure that every student is taught to take charge of his or her personal growth to be a leader of self, who is both responsible and respected by others. Parents who are our firm and supportive partners work collaboratively to motivate, encourage and spur our students to be confident learners and leaders."
