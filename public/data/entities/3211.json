		"School Mission": "A close-knit school, in partnership with the community, nurturing students to be resilient in their pursuit of excellence.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Jurong Secondary School (JSS) was founded in 1963 at the request of community leaders to our Founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, when he made his first visit to the Jurong Constituency. Originally named Jurong Integrated Secondary School, the school offered both the English and Chinese streams. Stemming from this rich history, JSS became widely known for its rich Chinese heritage, strong community partnerships and all-round education for its students. Innovative programmes guided by the school values of Loyalty, Industry, Sincerity, and Love were introduced to nurture character, cultivate thinking and independent learning, and enable students to pursue excellence while growing as concerned citizens who contribute meaningfully back to the community. As a FutureSchool@Singapore pioneer, JSS leverages ICT to design learning experiences that emphasise the 21st century competencies.",
