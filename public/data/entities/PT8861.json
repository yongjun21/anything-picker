  "remarks": "(Under the Management of Ichiban Montessori Group) Ichiban Montessori is dedicated to the education of children in an environment designed to stimulate and develop the child?s love for learning. Everything that occurs within our pre-schools will be aimed at achieving this underlying philosophy. Ichiban Montessori aims to provide a dynamic, independent learning environment that is hands-on and student-driven for children ages 2 to 6 years old. Children develop inner-discipline, a love of learning, and learn at their own pace guided by the Montessori technique, which promotes individual initiative and creativity. We want our students to experience such a positive impact on their learning that our parents would never consider having them attend pre-school anywhere else!",
