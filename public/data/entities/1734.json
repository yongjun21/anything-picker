			"Qihua Primary School is the Hanyu Pinyin name of Kay Wah School. It was founded in 1938 by a group of forward-looking pioneers led by Mr Neo Tiew, a philanthropist and village head of Ama Keng. In Chinese, Qihua means 'rousing the learning spirit'  . The school then expanded from the Main school to Branch I and II, to accommodate the quest for learning of the residents' children in that area. The school adopted English as its medium of instruction and shifted to Woodlands in 1980, continuing its journey in serving the community."
