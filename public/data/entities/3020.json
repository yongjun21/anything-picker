		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The curricular and co-curricular programmes in Yishun Secondary School are designed to develop confident and competent Yishunites who are Thinkers, Innovators and Contributors. Students enjoy differentiated learning experiences through inter-disciplinary programmes such as School Area for Integrated Learning (SAIL) in outdoor learning environments, English-Mathematics-ICT-Science (EMITS) Day and Joy of Life-long Learning, Innovation and Enterprise (JoLLIE). These experiential activities challenge students to solve real world problems and numerous other activities such as inter-class debates and public speaking showcases build confidence and prepare Yishunites for life in and beyond secondary school. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Sonic Arts (Music, Media and Technology) leverages new media to provide students with a strong foundation in and exposure to established and emerging disciplines in Music Technology and Recording Arts. In addition to stretching the students academically, the School's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Leading with Empathy, Serving with Compassion, creates platforms for students to lead in serving the community and provides opportunities for Yishunites to broaden their understanding of the needs and aspirations of the community. Through these authentic experiences, students' leadership skills and attitudes are developed and enhanced. Key features of our Character and Citizen Education Programme include Citizenship Education Learning Journeys, the Sec 2 Adventure Camp and the Yishun Secondary School Goes Global Programme. The school also builds on its strong partnerships with various community groups to achieve its aims of equipping Yishunites with the appropriate skillsets to face the challenges of tomorrow."
