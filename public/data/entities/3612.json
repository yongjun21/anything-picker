		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school offers a variety of programmes to widen the students' learning experiences for greater development in cognitive, social-moral, leadership, physical and aesthetic domains. The school's distinctive Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Aerospace equips Brooksians with knowledge in aerospace topics and essential STEM skills. The ALP provides Brooksians with an edge when applying for aerospace-related courses at the Institute of Higher Learning. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Outdoor Education aims to develop character, inculcate values of grit and resilience and build leadership traits in all students, as they learn adventure skills such as orienteering as well as cultivate an appreciation for the environment. In addition, the Stained Glass Art Programme empowers the students to express their creativity and develop their spirit of innovation. As the making of stained glass artwork requires skill and patience, students working in teams will develop fortitude while learning to value each other's strengths. Northbrooks offers a range of Values-in-Action opportunities for all students.  All students take part in Recyclatron, an annual recycling activity which allows students to spread the message of the 5Rs - Refuse; Reduce; Reuse; Repair and Recycle.  The Secondary Two students undergo a learning journey to VWOs to learn the fundamentals of Service Learning while the Secondary Three students initiate a service learning project leveraging on Design Thinking processes. The Whole-School Approach to Effective Communication (WSA-EC) and D.E.A.R. (Drop Everything And Read) Time aims to build students' competencies in communicating and reading in English and Mother Tongue Languages. By building all these competencies, the school hopes to better prepare a stronger generation for the future."
