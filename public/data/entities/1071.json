			"The school dates back to 1956 when many schools in the neighbourhood closed due to dwindling enrolment and their students were moved to Queenstown Primary School (QtPS). The current QtPS was formed through a merger of Mei Chin Primary, Tanglin Primary and the old Queenstown Primary in January 2002. The school underwent PRIME at the end of November 1999 when the old buildings were demolished and rebuilt on site. This is then followed by PERI upgrading in 2010.",
			"The school believes that Every Child Matters and can Accomplish. With this belief, the school endeavours to develop ",
			"- A Child - a confident and happy child; motivated and passionate about learning.",
			"- An Explorer - one who embraces challenges and diversity, possesses an open mind, and dares to try new things.",
			"- A Friend - one who loves and cares for his family, shows care and concern for the less privileged, the community, the environment and the nation.",
			"To achieve this, the school is committed to providing a holistic education to develop confident and self-directed learners, concerned citizens and active contributors. This process is guided by the school's values of Questioning Mind, Quality Work, Perseverance, Positive Thinking, Sincerity and Self-discipline for both students and staff."
