Learning through the arts, our students will embody intellectual curiosity in art-making, tenacity in their learning attitude and steadfast values in collaborative endeavours. Above all, Tampinesians should grow through our LLP to become individuals of good character who are responsible to family, community and nation. To promote applied learning in the academic domain, the school has an Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in 'Creative Engineering: Inter-disciplinary Authentic Problem Solving'. The school has integrated problem solving into the disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Since 2017, the school has introduced Maker Faire as a CCA and in 2019 the subject, Electronics, has been offered in the upper secondary curriculum to extend the interests of students in STEM."
