Our mission is to shape the lives of Gabrielites who will serve the community as Servant Leaders, who are  Lifelong Learners and Gracious Citizens. Our philosophy of education is guided by the Montfortian Education Charter, formed by an understanding and study of the life and works of St. Louis Marie de Montfort. We design our programmes and curriculum to develop Gabrielites grounded in the values  of Respect, Resilience, Responsibility and Care. We emphasize and respect the need for personal spiritual growth and sustain it through daily reflections and actions. Our motto, Labour Omnia Vincit (Labour Conquers All), rallies Gabrielites to persevere in all endeavours with tenacity and determination. In our Gabrielite community, there is a strong culture of care amongst staff as well as students. This care is extended to the larger community, putting our values into action through service.   Our school has sustained high levels of achievement in the areas of academia, sports, aesthetics and uniformed groups. Our character and leadership programme aims to grow and nurture our students to be Servant Leaders through progressive development from self-directed to  collaborative learners and eventually serving actively and leading effectively.",
