The school believes that learning is a lifelong pursuit that requires discipline, responsibility and self-directedness. To this end, school programmes are all-rounded, values-driven and anchored on strong fundamentals. The school nurtures in students good habits of reading, reflection and critical thinking, all of which stand them in good stead in an increasingly complex and ever-changing environment. Northland Secondary also centres around a culture of care. We build positive relationships based on respect and empathy for others. The school uses the metaphor of the Northstar to communicate our firm belief in each of our students' ability and potential, as well as the purpose of our work as educators. Consistent in brilliance, unwavering through different seasons of life, we aim to develop each Northstar to be a Critical Thinker, an Active Sportsman, a Servant Leader, a Concerned Citizen, a Creative Artiste and A Caring Friend.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school adopts a whole-school approach to holistic education through the following signature programmes.  All levels of students participate in SPARCLE 1, a week-long experiential learning experience which centres on the socio-emotional and physical domains of development. Through a focus on Character Development & ECG, students participate in level camps, elective modules, as well as our signature Northland Overseas VIA (NOVIA) trips. NOVIA seeks to broaden students' horizons as they serve in cross-cultural contexts. In addition, students participate in SPARCLE 2 as well, which centres on the cognitive and aesthetic domains of development. During SPARCLE 2, through an interdisciplinary, thematic approach to project-based learning, students collaborate to experience Joy of Learning through a real-world journey through the academic disciplines and the arts. In addition, in response to real-world problems, the school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) on Gerontology and Geriatrics aims to enable our students to acquire knowledge about the biological, cognitive and social aspects of aging through hands-on activities and scientific experiments. Game for Life is the school's Learning for Life Programme, which develops students' socio-emotional competencies through an exciting variety of sports and physical activities across the year, inculcating habits which empower them to engage in healthy pursuits throughout life. The school has a proud sporting tradition, especially in Hockey and Floorball, with several players representing Singapore in prestigious international competitions."
