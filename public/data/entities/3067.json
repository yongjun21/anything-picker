MeLIT is a three-year programme to develop students' information management skills such as evaluating and interpreting information sources, and to deliver specific messages through the creation of media products with close integration to English and Humanities.  The school's Learning for Life Programme is STAR (Sportsmanship, Teamwork And Resilience) where students develop these values through physical activities such as sports and outdoor adventure camps. To nurture students into ladies and gentlemen of Character and Learning, all Lower Secondary students attend a Character Development Adventure Camp and Sec 3 students participate in a 5-day MOE-Outward Bound School Challenge Programme.  There are opportunities for Sec 3 students to take part in student exchange programmes with schools in Cambodia and Taiwan. In addition, students take part in Integrated Humanities and CCE Learning Journeys, CCE Lectures, Harmony@Senja (Integrated VIA/CCE Programme) and Leadership Development Programmes."
