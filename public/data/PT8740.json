  "remarks": "Kinderland is a leading regional provider of quality infant and child care services, bilingual preschool education and premier student care programmes to children from 2 months to 12 years of age.   Established in 1978, Kinderland?s programmes emphasise on the total development of a child - balancing academic studies with meaningful experiences to equip children for formal schooling. Learning is integrated through play, discovery and creative activities. Music literacy, language and the arts are integral components of the Kinderland Integrated Curriculum (KIC), and we provide electronic music keyboards for our children to learn keyboarding skills under the tutelage of qualified music teachers.  Kinderland?s proprietary curricula are uniquely designed by an in-house curriculum research and development team, which is supported by an international advisory panel from Australia, America, China and Singapore.  Kinderland currently has more than 40 preschools and child care centres in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh.",
